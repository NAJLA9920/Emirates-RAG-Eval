Stages of school education,"The Ministry of Education applies the following stages and cycles for education K-12 in the government schools. Kindergarten (4-5 years) Kindergarten in the UAE is voluntary and accommodates children who are below the age of admission to the first grade. Kindergarten consists of two levels, where children attend two years of mixed-gender classes: 
1) Kindergarten 1 (KG1) 
2) Kindergarten 2 (KG2) 
 This level prepares the children to be successful in primary level or (Cycle 1) and beyond. KG students spend their time developing social, language, physical and academic skills. School cycles In 2018, Ministry of Education amended the number of school grades in each stage cycle which will be effective from the academic year 2018-2019. Each school stage will have four grades instead of six as it was before in government schools. Basic level: primary or elementary level/Cycle1 In this level, children complete Grades 1 to 4. This level provides a rich learning environment to inspire this age group as they begin their educational journey. Intermediate level/Cycle 2 In this level, children complete Grades 6 to 8. This level aims to nurture young students for the future and help them become fully-developed members of society. Secondary level/Cycle 3 In this level, students complete Grades 9 to 12. In this level, students are prepared for the starting point in their career and place in the society. Once completing this level, the student will be granted a high school certificate, which indicates passing 12 years of compulsory education. Students who attended the technical secondary school will be awarded the technical secondary diploma upon completing this level."
Educational streams in public schools,"Prior to 2015, students chose either the scientific or the literary stream. However, MoE abolished this system and instead introduced four streams: 
1) the General stream 
2) the Professional stream 
3) the Advanced stream 
4) the Elite stream (Advanced Science Program-ASP). 
 All students will begin from Grade one in the general stream of learning. Depending on each student’s desire and performance, a student will be readmitted into a specific stream at a certain grade. After finishing Grade 8, a student can choose to join the Professional stream (Vocational stream), where he will continue studying Grades 9, 10, 11 and 12 and will obtain an applied high school certificate which is equivalent to technical high school certificate. The professional (vocational track) follows a practical curriculum for education. Learning is based on applying knowledge and developing students’ practical skills. After finishing Grade 9 and depending on their performance, students can choose either to remain in the general stream or to join the advanced stream. In both, general and advanced streams students will continue Grades 10, 11 and 12. The key difference between the general stream and the advanced stream is the range of scientific subjects. Students in the advanced track will receive more in-depth instruction in maths and sciences than those in the general track. The elite stream is developed for academically outstanding students. The stream will admit students from Grade 6 until they finish Grade 12. Elite curriculum focuses on mathematics and science in a way that enhances the skills in analysis, reasoning and problem-solving."

Provisions for people of determination,"The term special education describes the programmes and services designed for people of determination (people with special needs) in order to ensure that all students can reach their full potential. The term 'special educational needs' is used to describe the educational needs of any one with a disability, disorder, difficulty, impairment, exceptionality or any other factor that may affect a student's access to learning and educational performance. The government of the UAE strongly supports education and learning services for people of determination. In November 2006, the UAE signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and Optional Protocol . Federal Law No. 29 of 2006 , is the first law in the UAE to protect the rights of people of determination. Article 12 of the law provides: the country guarantees people with special needs equal opportunities in education within all educational, vocational training, adult education and continuing education institutions in regular classes or special classes with the availability of curriculum in sign language or Braille and or any other methods as appropriate. Ministry of Education's (MoE) strategy is to adapt public schools to facilitate education for people of determination. Accordingly, people of determination are entitled to enrol in any school, without exception. These students are catered for by Department of Special Education, which was established in 2008 by MoE. This Department promotes the rights of people of determination and ensures that they have access to the same educational opportunities as students in the regular education system. Education is of the pillars of the ' National Policy for Empowering People of Determination '. T he government will provide an integrative education system in public and vocational education and adapt school curricula to cater their needs. It will also provide qualified teachers and specialists, appropriate supportive technologies and learning materials."
Inclusive education for people of determination,"The UAE has made tangible efforts to include people of determination in mainstream education. These efforts are reflected in the Ministerial Resolution No. 647 for the year 2020 on the policy of inclusive education (PDF in Arabic, 500 KB), which directs government schools to adapt themselves to cater to the needs of people of determination and provide them with the best education services. Additionally, the ministry established the People of Determination Department (formerly known as the Special Education Department), in 2008 to protect the rights of students of determination and provide them with equal opportunities as other students. The ministry also provides all supporting services (mentioned below) to students of determination for free in government schools. The ministry provides specialised teachers with high behavioural skills that enable them to care for people of determination. It also launched several skill training programmes that include clear instructions on dealing with people with visual and hearing impairment. It launched programmes for teachers to identify talents, understand sign language for those with hearing difficulties, and know how to properly deal with language disorders experienced by children. The ministry has established support centres across the UAE to follow up on the progress of students of determination before and after inclusion within schools. These centres provide different services such as diagnosis of students with disabilities and learning difficulties, providing recommendations, assisting parents in dealing with their child's condition, and advising support services suitable for their children. Services and facilities for students of determination The schools are required to provide the following facilities for students of determination: 
1) wheelchair ramps and elevators, toilets, buses, cars and parking spaces prepared for students with physical disabilities 
2) special education resource rooms and sensory and comprehensive rooms 
3) specialised human cadres such as: special education teacher, teacher assistant, escort, sign language interpreter, Braille education specialist, visual impairment specialist, psychologist, speech and language specialist, special education specialist 
4) assessment and diagnosis of students of determination by a multidisciplinary team 
5) support services and individual and group treatment and rehabilitation sessions, according to their needs such as speech and language sessions, Braille education sessions, behaviour modification sessions, sign language sessions 
6) counselling, awareness and guidance sessions for parents of students of determination 
7) devices and assistive technologies according to their special needs 
8) workshops and courses for administration staff, teachers, guides, specialists and parents of students.

How to register for VAT?,"Businesses can register for VAT through the eServices section on the FTA website. However, they need to create an account first. For general queries about tax registration and/or application, you may contact Federal Tax Authority through the ' Contact us ' page."
How is VAT collected?,VAT-registered businesses collect the amount on behalf of the government; consumers bear the VAT in the form of a 5 per cent increase in the cost of taxable goods and services they purchase in the UAE. UAE imposes VAT on tax-registered businesses at a rate of 5 per cent on a taxable supply of goods or services at each step of the supply chain. Tourists in the UAE also pay VAT at the point of sale .
On which businesses does VAT apply?,"Certain free zones have been specified as designated zones for VAT purposes . While special rules apply to supplies made in the designated zones, the businesses established in such zones may still need to register for VAT provided the criteria for registration is met."
Implications of VAT,"Implication of VAT on individuals VAT, as a general consumption tax, will apply to the majority of transactions in goods and services. A limited number of exemptions may be granted. As a result, the cost of living is likely to increase slightly, but this will vary depending on an individual's lifestyle and spending behaviour. If an individual spends mainly on those things which are relieved from VAT, he is unlikely to see any significant increase. The government will include rules that require businesses to be clear about how much VAT an individual is required to pay for each transaction. Based on this information, individuals can decide whether to buy something. Implication of VAT on businesses Businesses will be responsible for carefully documenting their business income, costs and associated VAT charges. Registered businesses and traders will charge VAT to all of their customers at the prevailing rate and incur VAT on goods/services that they buy from suppliers. The difference between these sums is reclaimed or paid to the government. VAT-registered businesses generally: 
1) must charge VAT on taxable goods or services they supply 
2) may reclaim any VAT they have paid on business-related goods or services 
3) keep a range of business records which will allow the government to check that they have got things right. 
 VAT-registered businesses must report the amount of VAT they have charged and the amount of VAT they have paid to the government on a regular basis. It will be a formal submission and  reporting will be done online. If they have charged more VAT than they have paid, they have to pay the difference to the government. If they have paid more VAT than they have charged, they can reclaim the difference. VAT in GCC The UAE coordinates VAT implementation with other GCC countries because she is connected with them through 'The Economic Agreement between the GCC States' and 'The GCC Customs Union'. Read Common VAT Agreement of the States of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) (PDF, 200 KB)."
File VAT returns,"At the end of each tax period, VAT registered businesses or the ‘taxable persons’ must submit a ‘VAT return’ to Federal Tax Authority (FTA). A VAT return summarises the value of the supplies and purchases a taxable person has made during the tax period, and shows the taxable person’s VAT liability. Liability of VAT The liability of VAT is the difference between the output tax payable (VAT charged on supplies of goods and services) for a given tax period and the input tax (VAT incurred on purchases) recoverable for the same tax period. Where the output tax exceeds the input tax amount, the difference must be paid to FTA. Where the input tax exceeds the output tax, a taxable person will have the excess input tax recovered; he will be entitled to set this off against subsequent payment due to FTA. How to file VAT return? You must file for tax return electronically through the FTA portal: eservices.tax.gov.ae .  Before filing the VAT return form on the portal, make sure you have met all tax returns requirements. When are businesses required to file VAT return? Taxable businesses must file VAT returns with FTA on a regular basis and usually within 28 days of the end of the ‘tax period’ as defined for each type of business. A ‘tax period’ is a specific period of time for which the payable tax shall be calculated and paid. The standard tax period is: 
1) quarterly for businesses with an annual turnover below AED150 million 
2) monthly for businesses with an annual turnover of AED150 million or more. 
 The FTA may, at its choice, assign a different tax period for certain type of businesses. Failure to file a tax return within the specified time frame will make the violator liable for fines as per the provisions of Cabinet Resolution No. 40 of 2017 on Administrative Penalties for Violations of Tax Laws in the UAE (PDF, 1 MB).

What is Ramadan?,"Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. It is regarded as the holiest month of the year as it was the month in which the Quran was revealed to Prophet Mohammad (peace be upon him) on the night of Laylat Al Qadr, one of the last ten nights of Ramadan. Ramadan is the month of piety, charity and blessings. During Ramadan, capable Muslims are required to abstain from eating and drinking from dawn to dusk. Such fasting is one of the five pillars of Islam. Like other months, Ramadan too begins at the first sighting of the new crescent moon and lasts 29 or 30 days depending on the sighting of the next crescent. The UAE follows an official announcement in this regard from the moon-sighting committee in Makkah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as Makkah is considered the holiest city in the Islamic world. It is the birthplace of Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) and also the location where he had his first revelation of the Quran. The Islamic calendar has 354 days. Hence, Ramadan arrives 11 days earlier in every subsequent year of the Gregorian calendar. People greet each other by saying 'Ramadan Kareem', which means 'Happy Ramadan'."
How is Ramadan observed in the UAE?,"The Ramadan traditions in the UAE start mid-Shaaban (the month preceding Ramadan). This day is known as Hagg Al-Layla. Emirati children dress in their best clothes and go to houses in the neighbouring areas reciting songs and poems. The neighbours welcome them with sweets and nuts, which is collected by children in traditional cloth bags. There are two main meals in Ramadan: Suhoor and Iftar. Suhoor is consumed early in the morning before sunrise, just before fasting hours start. Iftar is the meal to break the fast. Following the example of the Prophet Muhammad, fasting is broken with dates and laban (buttermilk) throughout the Islamic world. On the first night of Ramadan, the family gathers at the house of the male head of the family, usually the grandfather, for their first Iftar. In the UAE and the other GCC countries, dates are considered as the 'bread of the desert'. Gars, a bread-like crumble with dates and cardamom, is a popular Emirati sweet dish during Ramadan. Other common dishes are Harees and Threed. Read about where you can eat Emirati food . Firing the cannon (Midfa Al Iftar) is an integral part of the Islamic culture and takes place in many regions across the country. It can be heard around 8-10 km away. It signals the moment when Muslims can break their fast. This tradition is known to people since the rule of the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the Founder President of the UAE. Children wait for the sound of the big bang. To them, Iftar cannon is the most fun thing that happens during this month, apart from the sweets and other special meals and activities arranged for them. Members of the UAE military carry out this tradition with appropriate safety precautions. Those who suffer certain barrier such as illness or pregnancy are not obligated to fast as per health professionals' advice. Those who were travelling may fast later. Children are not required to fast until they have reached puberty, although many still do out of choice. In addition to abstaining from eating, drinking and smoking, Muslims also should refrain from sinful speech and behaviour. In addition to the regular 5 daily prayers, Muslim men and women perform Tarawih prayers daily after Isha prayers in mid-evening. During the last ten days, many devoted Muslims spend the whole day in mosques, praying and reciting the Quran, in anticipation of the Laylat Al Qadr, the night of the first revelation of the Quran. Reciting different chapters each day from the Quran is appreciated throughout the month of Ramadan. Observing Ramadan provides a spiritual experience. It is the time for Muslims to practice self-discipline, sacrifice and empathy for the less fortunate. It encourages generosity and charity."

Red Crescent Authority (RCA) and Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan Foundation and other charitable organisations set up tents in various locations in the UAE to offer free Iftar meals. Setting up Ramadan tents is a fundamental practice in the UAE's tradition. It reflects the spirit of giving and sharing with people from different nationalities, social status and financial backgrounds who sit together to break their fast. Tents are usually seen near mosques, in open spaces and at the entrances of some Emiratis' houses. One can experience Emirati hospitality and traditions at these tents. Many public and private organisations distribute boxes of meals, dates and water at mosques and malls daily shortly before Iftar time.

Virtual digital pleading,"The ‘ Virtual digital pleading’ enables litigants in a lawsuit to submit their statements and requests before the courts using digital channels without any limitations of location or time. The service facilitates the plaintiff to access the system and record his/her statements and requests in the lawsuit, and at the same time, enables the defendant to respond to these requests under the supervision of the competent judge or case manager. Both parties can exchange requests and responses throughout the designated session day. The platform provides a virtual environment that meets the needs of litigants and lawyers, offering fast, efficient, transparent and advanced justice, 24/7. The pleading process involves a back-and-forth exchange between the two parties of the case, where they present their defences, arguments, evidence and requests using memoranda, documents, previous judicial rulings and evidence. Previously, the process of appearing before a judge for litigation took place either in person or virtually, with sessions scheduled in advance. However, this approach demanded considerable time, effort and procedural requirements from the parties involved. With the introduction of the ‘Virtual digital pleading’, the pleading has changed into an instant conversation format between the parties involved. This conversation occurs directly, with their statements being recorded and documented in the digital pleading minutes and the digital case record. The service can be accessed and the digital pleading minutes can be viewed via smart phones or the website round the clock so that the lawsuit parties can add any new evidence or document when they want. This accelerates the pace of litigation, shortens many procedures and contributes to achieving rapid and prompt justice. This service is in line with the UAE Strategy for Government Services , which aims to facilitate digital transformation and provide the best government services in the world. Related links

Then, the case is filed to be seen by the judge in the respective Court of First Instance."
Filing a lawsuit,"Filing lawsuits requires the plaintiff or his/her representative to submit a 'statement of claim' and supporting documents to the Case Management Office in the court or by creating electronic records for such lawsuits. Each defendant is entitled to receive a copy of the plaintiff’s claim. The statement of claim mainly include: 
1) the plaintiff's and the defendant's personal details and addresses 
2) the subject-matter of the lawsuit 
3) the requests and grounds 
4) the date of submission of the lawsuit to the Case Management Office 
5) the court before which the lawsuit is filed 
6) the signature of the plaintiff or his representative. 
 If the case is related to nullification, revocation or validation of a contract, a copy of the contract is required. For the implementation of judgements issued abroad, the UAE's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation should attest the original judgement. Documents presented to the UAE's courts must be in Arabic; otherwise, it should be translated into Arabic by a legal translator approved by the UAE's Ministry of Justice. The plaintiff should sign the lawsuit if it is to be submitted by the attorney. After submitting the documents, the plaintiff or the attorney will be asked to pay the court fee based on the type of the case. After that, the court will give the case a number and a date for the hearing. The clerk, through the court official (the bailiff), will serve a notification on the defendant within 10 days from the date the statement was filed. The litigant should make sure that the court has the jurisdiction to hear the case according to the provisions of the UAE Civil Procedures law, section 3. Related links

"
Determining a court's jurisdiction,"In general, a court's jurisdiction lies in the defendant's domicile. If he has no domicile, then the jurisdiction would be the area of his residence or work. In commercial cases, the plaintiff can choose the court to which he can bring a claim to. He can bring it to either: 
1) the court in the area where the defendant resides 
2) the court in the area where the agreement was made, or executed wholly or partially 
3) the court in the area where the contract should have been performed. 
 For other types of situations,  Federal Law No.11 of 1992 Concerning the Civil Procedural Law, as amended determines the jurisdiction of the courts."
Appointment of attorneys/lawyers,"Ministry of Justice provides an online service to search for a lawyer in the UAE to help people find a suitable lawyer. Only UAE national lawyers with a valid licence are allowed to appear before the UAE courts. The lawyers should be licensed by the UAE's Ministry of Justice and must be registered in the roll of practising lawyers. The court accepts the authorisation of attorneys in accordance with the provisions of the law. The representative must prove his appointment through an official power of attorney attested by a notary public. The appointment gives the attorney the power to perform all necessary actions and procedures to file a lawsuit, follow-up on its proceedings, defend and take precautionary measures until a decision on its merits is rendered.

"
Estimating case value,"The value of the case is estimated on the day of trial. The valuation should be based on the last request made by the parties in the lawsuit and shall include indemnities, revenues and expenditure etc. due on the day of trial."
Responding to a civil action,"The defendant should submit a defence memorandum (a plea) to the Case Management Office and copies of his documents bearing his signature at least three days before the date of hearing. The time limit for appearing before the court is normally 10 days, which may be reduced if necessary, to 3 days. The time limit for the appearance in urgent actions is 24 hours, which may be reduced to an hour if necessary, provided that the litigant party is notified about it."
Appearing before court,"On the day scheduled for hearing the case, the parties or their attorneys are required to appear before the court. The hearing will be held in the first session and if the plaintiff or the defendant submits a document in this session which he could have submitted while filing the case, the court may accept it if it would not result in the adjournment of proceedings.  If the submission results in an adjournment, the court on its own motion or at the request of the litigating parties, may decide to impose a fine. If the plaintiff or the defendant fails to attend the hearing, the court shall decide if it is a valid one or decide its removal. If no party requests to proceed with the case or attends the sitting after 60 days passed, the case will be cancelled. If the defendant alone, after receiving the notification, fails to attend the hearing, the court will decide in the lawsuit unless he was not served with the notification, wherein the court, in non-summary proceedings, may adjourn the hearing to the following session. The court may not postpone a lawsuit more than once for the same reason cited by one party except for a valid excuse, if the adjournment period shall not be for more than two weeks. If the court finds that it lacks jurisdiction to hear the case, it should order the case referral to the competent court and the court clerk should notify the parties about the decision."
Ending a civil action,"A civil action may be ended if both parties agree not to proceed with the case and get approval for this from the court. Such cessation could be for a period of six months from the date of the court's approval as per Article 101 of Civil Procedural Law. No party shall be allowed to expedite the case during this period, except with the consent of the other."
Pronouncing a judgement,"The judgement is pronounced publicly by the judge or the head of the circuit according to the circumstances. The court, in issuing its verdict, shall automatically decide on the expenses of the lawsuit as well. The expenses of the lawsuit should be borne by the party against whom the judgement was passed and they shall include the advocacy fee. If several persons were convicted, the court may decide to divide the expenses equally or on a pro-rata basis, in accordance with its estimation."
Petition for review of a judgement,"The litigants may seek a review of the final judgement if: 
1) the opponent's fraud influenced the court's ruling 
2) the court's decision was based on papers which were confirmed to be falsified after the issuance of the ruling 
3) the ruling was  based on the testimony of a witness who was later adjudged false. 
"

Proceedings,"The Federal Law No. 35 of 1992 as amended , specifies the procedures for criminal cases in the UAE. It comprises a set of rules that describe the methodology and procedures for criminal investigation, the trial of accused, rendering judgement, conditions for appealing judgement at upper courts and the enforcement of judgement. As per Article 7 of the Criminal Procedures Law , as amended, Public Prosecution has exclusive jurisdiction to initiate and prosecute criminal proceedings. It also has the authority to track it until a final judgement is rendered. Public Prosecution is part of the judicial body. It assumes the authority of investigation and imposing charges, as well as referring the accused person to the competent court if his involvement in the crime is proven. It also undertakes issues regarding the surrender of criminals and its follow-up in accordance with the international conventions, in cooperation with International Criminal Police. However, in some cases as listed in Article 10 of the same Law, written or verbal complaint by the victim or his legal representative are necessary for filing a criminal action. These instances include: 
1) theft, breach of trust and the concealment of the proceeds thereof, if the victim is a spouse of the perpetrator or one of the perpetrator’s ascendants or descendants and the proceeds are not seized judicially or administratively or encumbered by a lien in favour of another person 
2) refusal to deliver a minor to or taking the minor away from the authority of the minor’s custodian 
3) insult, slander and other crimes as specified by the law. 
 Provided, in the above cases the complaint will not be accepted after three months since the victim knew about the crime and the party who committed a crime, unless otherwise provided by the law. If the accused was caught red-handed, the complaint may be submitted to any public authority officer (i.e. police officer) attending the scene of the incident. If there is more than one victim in the crime, a complaint from one of them is enough to initiate a criminal action. If more than one person was accused of a crime, and the complaint was filed against one of them, it also applies to the other accused. Where the victims are less than 15 years old or mentally challenged, or if the crime was committed against their property, the complaint shall be submitted by their legal guardian. In case of a conflict of interest between the victim and his representative or if the victim has nobody to represent him, the public prosecutor will act for him. The public prosecution carries out the investigation in Arabic. In case the accused, the litigating parties, the witnesses or others whose statements are deemed critical by the public prosecutor do not know Arabic, the prosecution may seek the help of an interpreter after taking the oath."
Lapse of criminal actions,"A criminal action lapses if the victim withdraws his complaint. In case there are multiple victims, a criminal action would lapse when all victims who submitted the complaint withdraw the complaint. In criminal cases where more than one person is accused, withdrawal of the complaint against one of them takes effect for the others as well. If the victim dies after submitting a complaint, the right of withdrawal passes to his legal heirs. The criminal case also lapses with the death of the accused, issuance of a final judgement, withdrawal of legal action by the party which has the right to do so, issuance of an amnesty or repeal of the law which penalises such acts. Criminal cases also lapse after 20 years in felonies (serious crimes) punished by death sentences, 10 years in all other felonies, 3 years in misdemeanour and 1 year in violations. Useful links

"
Tracking crimes and collection of evidence,"Judicial officers from different government departments have the authority to inspect crimes and collect evidence. These include judicial officers from the Police Department, the Public Prosecution and the Criminal Courts. In addition, according to Article 32 of the Criminal Procedures Law, various other persons are authorised to gather evidence in criminal investigations. They include: 
1) officers of the armed forces 
2) border police 
3) coastguards 
4) immigration officers 
5) municipalities' inspectors and  inspectors of the Ministry of Health and Prevention. 
"
Role of police and Public Prosecution,"The role of police is to safeguard the public, take initial statements from complainants and witnesses, arrest suspects, carry out investigations and execute orders from the Public Prosecution to assist in the investigation process. Criminal actions in the UAE commence with filing a complaint with the local police in the jurisdiction where the offence was committed. During the investigation, police may take the statements of any parties involved. Local police usually refer the matter to the prosecutor's office within 48 hours of the filing of the complaint. The Public Prosecution should question the accused within 24 hours and then order either his arrest or release as per Article 47 of the law."
Rights and obligations of individuals,"The UAE's judicial system respects the dignity of people. The criminal procedural law presumes that an accused is innocent until proven guilty. Therefore, it observes certain procedures when dealing with criminal cases. They are: 
1) No criminal penalty may be imposed on anyone until his guilt is proved according to the law. 
2) No one may be arrested, searched, detained or imprisoned except under the circumstances and conditions mentioned in the law. 
3) Detention or imprisonment may only take place in places designated for that purpose and for the period specified in the warrant issued by the competent authority. 
4) Law enforcement authorities such as police may not enter into any place of residence except under the circumstances specified in this law or in case of a request for assistance from the resident who could be under a serious threat to his life or property. 
5) Whoever comes to know about the occurrence of a crime that the public prosecution can file a criminal action against, without a complaint or a request, must report it to the public prosecution or judicial officers. 
6) Anyone who witnesses the offender committing a felony or misdemeanour should hand him over to the nearest public authority without the need for an arrest warrant. 
7) The accused can ask the court to compensate him for the prejudice suffered due to the harmful accusation made by the victim or the accuser. 
"
Rights to an attorney,"Anyone accused of a felony (or a serious crime) punishable by a death sentence or life imprisonment may have a lawyer to defend him at the trial stage. If the accused did not appoint a lawyer, the court shall provide him with a lawyer whose fees are to be incurred by the state, as provided by the law. The accused in a felony punished by provisional imprisonment may also ask the court to provide him with an attorney in his defence, after verifying his financial inability to hire a lawyer."
Investigation and arrest of the convict,"The judicial officer, upon his arrival at the crime scene (or where a person is caught red-handed) shall prevent people present at the scene from leaving it or going away until a report is drafted. The officer can also immediately call upon anyone who may have any clarification about the incident to give his statement. The judicial officer may order the arrest of the accused present at the scene of the incident with sufficient evidence of his perpetration of the crime under the circumstances mentioned in Article 45 of the law. If the accused is not present, the judicial officer may issue an arrest warrant, which has to be stated in the report. The arrest warrant should be enforced by one of the public authority officers. The judicial officer should hear the statements of the accused immediately after his arrest. If the accused does not present anything that substantiates his innocence, he should be sent to the relevant public prosecution within 48 hours. The Public Prosecution shall question him within 24 hours and then order either his arrest or release."
Search of persons and residences,"The judicial officer may search the accused under circumstances where his arrest is allowed as per the law and the accused may be frisked for what might be on his body, clothes or belongings from the things related to the crime or required for the investigation. If the accused is a female, a female assigned by the judicial officer should carry out the search after taking an oath. The witnesses attending the inspection should also be females. Defendant's home may not be searched without a search warrant from the public prosecution unless the defendant was caught red-handed and with strong hints that the defendant was hiding in his house such objects or papers which might uncover the truth. The search and the seizure of objects and papers should be carried out in the manner specified by the law."
UAE federal law on arbitration,"In May 2018, the UAE issued Federal Law No. 6 of 2018 on Arbitration (PDF) . The new arbitration law annuls articles 203 to 218 of the UAE Civil Procedures Law No. 11 of 1992 which tackled some provisions of arbitration in UAE. The new arbitration law contains 61 articles and it applies on: 
1) any arbitration conducted in the UAE, unless the parties agree that another law should govern the arbitration, provided it is not in conflict with the public order of the state. 
2) any international commercial arbitration conducted abroad, if the parties chose this law to govern such arbitration. 
3) any arbitration arising from a dispute in respect of a legal relationship, whether contractual or not, governed by UAE law, unless it is excluded by a special provision. 
 In addition to Federal Law No. 6 of 2018 on Arbitration, arbitration is also governed  by Federal Law No. 11 of 1992 concerning the Civil Procedural Law. The following sections of said code cover the use of arbitration: 
1) Chapter IV Execution of Foreign judgements- Articles 235 - 238 
2) Chapter V Execution procedures - Articles 239 - 243 
"
Arbitration,"Considering the UAE is a major trading hub and a host country for foreign investment, arbitration is becoming an optimal method, for parties to solve their commercial disputes. Many foreign investors prefer to assign their disputes to arbitration committees for many reasons such as: 
1) to avoid  long process of commercial disputes reviewed by courts of law 
2) to avoid controversial international laws and accordingly save time, money and efforts which would otherwise be spent on many sessions at the courts of law 
3) the lack of precedent doctrine in the UAE which makes the result of disputes somehow uncertain 
4) the fact that the court proceeding is conducted in Arabic. 
 The arbitrator's decision is viewed as a settlement having the power of execution once being acquired by the court of law concerned. In 2012, on an average, 57 per cent cases were settled through alternative methods. Refer to mediation . In addition to the above, a number of specialised federal courts were established to handle special types of cases. Some of them are: 
1) information technology courts 
2) consumer protection courts 
3) trans-border crimes courts 
4) state security court. 
"
Key arbitration institutions,"The Abu Dhabi Commercial, Conciliation and Arbitration Centre In 1993, Abu Dhabi Chamber established Abu Dhabi Commercial Conciliation and Arbitration Centre to settle trade disputes through conciliation and arbitration. The centre kept panels to register the names of specialists in the fields of conciliation, arbitration, expertise and translation. Conciliation is conducted through a mediator accredited by the centre or selected by both disputing parties. The conciliator's decision concerning a dispute is not considered binding, but it has the nature of recommendation on a proposal for dispute solving. The default language is Arabic, unless the parties expressly choose English. The Dubai International Arbitration Centre (DIAC) Dubai holds an autonomous arbitration institution known as Dubai International Arbitration Centre (DIAC) which replaced the former Centre for Commercial Conciliation and Arbitration. Read the DIAC Arbitration Rules, 2022 (PDF, 1 MB). International Islamic Centre for Reconciliation and Arbitration (IICRA) International Islamic Centre for Reconciliation and Arbitration (IICRA) is an international, independent, non-profit organisation of the Islamic finance industry.

Correctional facilities,"The correctional facilities in the UAE observe human rights and serve as rehabilitation facilities . The UAE implements the Standard Minimum Rules for the treatment of prisoners (SMR) in punitive and correctional institutions nationwide. The facilities are subject to random visits from human rights' departments and public prosecutors. They inspect every part of the prison and have private interviews with the inmates. Convicts are segregated according to their crimes. Inmates receive their full rights in rehabilitation, medical care, nutrition, communicating with their families and their lawyers."
Rehabilitation of prisoners,"Rehabilitation forms a key element of the correctional strategy in the UAE. The government offers work readiness programme for UAE national inmates. The programme is operated by Higher Colleges of Technology, available to inmates who have only a year or two remaining of their sentence. The programme offers training to prisoners and employment opportunities for them when they complete their sentences. Related links

Since 1971, the government has set up many courts and public prosecution in all emirates. It has enacted many legislations to accommodate the ever-changing socio-economic needs of the UAE.

It also offers training for government bodies' personnel, whose jobs are related to law and judicial fields, as well as, scientific research and its usage within the law and judicial fields. Raising children's legal knowledge Juvenile offences make up a significant percentage of all cases examined by prosecutors in the UAE. Studies showed that juveniles tended to carry out crime because of a low level of awareness about the seriousness of such misdemeanours under the law. The offences were often committed on the spur of the moment. By teaching youth about the law at an early age, youngsters will be more likely to turn into responsible adults. Abu Dhabi Judicial Department (ADJD) had declared 2015 as ' child's legal knowledge year' . The initiative aimed at teaching youngsters about their legal responsibilities. The campaigns included short videos about wrong actions and their damaging results, like one who fights in school, uses the mobile phone to insult others or causes disturbance. Useful links

Safety and security initiatives,"Mindful of the global security challenges and developments in the present world, the government has launched many initiatives to safeguard its infrastructure. Among these are: Hedayah Centre In December 2012, UAE government launched the Hedayah Centre (Arabic for guidance), which aims to counter violent extremism by promoting understanding and sharing of good practices for the global interest. The Abu Dhabi Safety and Security Planning Manual The  Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council issued the Abu Dhabi Safety and Security Planning Manual - (PDF, 43.5 MB) to develop safe, secure and sustainable communities by ensuring that safety and security aspects are included in the development proposals. The SSPM is based on the belief that places that are not within common vision or easy sight prove to be a favourable place for crime to occur. The primary focus for the manual is to reduce crimes against the person through changes to the built environment. It combines the three disciplines of personnel, information and physical security in a manner to create 'defence in depth', where multiple layers work together to deter, delay, detect and deny an attack. The SSPM includes a set of strategies and measures that seek to reduce the risk of crimes occurring and their potentially harmful effects on individuals and society, by intervening in the multiple influencing factors/causes. For more information, read Abu Dhabi Vision 2030. Higher Committee for Crises and Terrorist Acts Management (HCCTAM) The emirate of Abu Dhabi established the Higher Committee for Crises and Terrorist Acts Management (HCCTAM). HCCTAM leads the emirate's efforts to counter terrorism and is the owner of the Counter Terrorism Strategy. This strategy is organised around a series of work streams, one of which is protection. The strategy seeks to increase the resilience of the UAE against attacks. Read more about Abu Dhabi's efforts to enhance safety in  the society (PDF, 1 MB) in Abu Dhabi Safety and Security Planning Manual. Community Protection Face Recognition initiative To enhance the security of the UAE, Ministry of Interior deployed a  face recognition system  using advanced technology to protect the borders of the UAE, as well as its critical infrastructure and key assets. The system's biometric software scans images of individual faces for analysis and identification. It uses sensitive cameras to capture the faces of people. The cameras can scan and capture images of people standing near and far from the camera and whether in motion or standing still. The UAE's smart initiatives to counter extremism and terrorism The UAE Government advocates fighting extremism by stopping suspicious funding, disrupting the recruitment of foreign fighters, securing borders, preventing the exploitation of the web and social media and by contesting the use of religious centres to promote hatred and violence. To this end, the government established the Sawab Center to restrict violent extremist messaging on the internet. The word Sawab in Arabic means doing the right thing. This online initiative counters false claims, highlights key activities conducted by the global coalition against extremists and amplifies credible voices to speak out against terror. Useful links

Training in safety,"The UAE established many safety-training institutions across the country to prepare and train potential leaders and civilian officers and improve their skills in identifying and assessing challenges to national, regional and international security. These institutions include: 
1) The National Security Institute (NSI) 
2) Rabdan Academy 
"
Security systems,"MoI uses the latest technologies to maintain security and boost productivity in police work. Some of them are: The 'Falcon Eye' system Abu Dhabi police utilises a complete central system, which called the falcon eye system . It covers Abu Dhabi city, Abu Dhabi International Airport, the main islands and the areas of Bani Yas and Musaffah. The system receives a live feed from visual surveillance equipment installed on site and displays data in an integral system that provides warnings and enables quick access to events and incidents. The system controls roads by monitoring traffic violations such as the use of hard shoulders, illegal parking and the misuse of roads and dealing with traffic accidents live. IRIS system-Abu Dhabi Police Abu Dhabi police uses  eye print system  to help identify persons by their iris patterns. It is based upon mathematical analysis of the random patterns visible in the iris of a person's eye (iris recognition). This system is effective, accurate and fast in detecting wanted persons and the process takes seconds to identify a person. Driverless mini police cars Dubai Police is considering launching autonomous, self-driving cars. The robotic vehicles will be equipped with biometric software to scan wanted criminals and those who are suspected of or are actually breaking the laws. The driverless vehicles will patrol different areas including tourist destinations of the city to boost security and hunt for unusual activity, all the while scanning crowds for known criminals and potential persons of interest to police. It can recognise people in any area and identify suspicious objects and can track suspects. Police officers can access the car through their fingerprint. The new security system is so advanced that the mini-vehicle even comes with its own drone, which can be launched via a rear sleeve — both are monitored and linked to Dubai Police command room. Flying bikes In October 2017, Dubai Police unveiled a model of a flying motorbike, Hoversurf. It can seat one police officer who would pilot the bike. However, it can also fly through remote operation. It is being considered for use during emergencies. Hoversurf works on electricity and can fly at five metres height. This feature is useful during emergencies and heavy traffic. The flying bike can travel up to a distance of 6 kilometres. It can fly for 25 minutes and can carry up to 300 kg of weight at a speed of 70 kmph."
Engaging public in maintaining security,"The UAE Government recognises that nation's security is a collective responsibility and that individuals can potentially help in realising security and preventing crimes. Therefore, it introduced some security services and  channels that enable people to communicate and report any suspicious or harmful incidents directly to the authorities. Some of them are: 
1) Call 999 to report crimes and emergencies while anywhere in the UAE 
 
1) Aman electronic system

The UAE’s efforts in maintaining food safety,"Food safety is an essential element of food security, especially in the UAE, which depends on imports for meeting a large part of its food needs. The UAE took the following measures to ensure food safety."
Federal law on food safety,"In January 2016, the late H. H. Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan approved the Federal Law No. 10 of 2015 on Food Safety (PDF, 250 KB) . The law imposes standards and regulations for maintaining the safety and quality of food and ensuring the protection of public health and consumers. The law imposes strict penalties on those found to be endangering food safety across the UAE. Some aspects of the food law are: 
1) No food may be imported into the country for the first time without approval of Ministry of Climate Change and Environment. 
2) Those dealing in food or products that contain pork or alcohol or any of their by-products without permission face a prison term of not less than a month and a fine of up to AED 500,000. 
3) Misleading consumers by publishing a false description of food or using incorrect labels will attract a fine ranging from AED 10,000 to 100,000. 
 The law authorises Ministry of Economy to impose fines of up to AED 100,000 for other offences, provided that these offences are regulated by the Cabinet. Through its National Food Safety Committee, the Ministry of Climate Change & Environment works with its partners on implementing the  law on safety of food and its executive regulations, which includes strict controls and standards to ensure food safety throughout the food chain."
National Food Accreditation and Registration System,"A per the Ministerial Decree No. 239 of 2018 on National Food Accreditation and Registration System  (250 KB, PDF in Arabic), food whether imported or locally produced or modified on its food label or ingredients or composition must be registered in the electronic system (ZAD) , which is an integrated smart platform for food products data , before being handled in the UAE’s markets."
The National Rapid Alert System for Food,"The National Rapid Alert System for Food was launched in 2017 to ensure proper implementation of response measures when serious food risks are detected. The system identifies the mechanisms of managing food risk alerts as well as banning and lifting of bans on adulterated and misbranded food. The components of the system include: assignment of responsibilities and roles, identifying types of food alerts, identifying the criteria to report food incidents, including border rejection of food and adulterated products in the market. The system applies a classification matrix to the food incidents as either high, medium or low. It also includes the triggers for the classification, namely the severity of risk to public health, the size and scale of an incident and the number of people affected by it."
Controlling imported food for non-trading purposes,"According to Ministerial Decree No. 14 of 2016 on Controlling of Imported Food for Non-trading Purpose (300 KB, PDF in Arabic), personal food is allowed to be imported through the country’s borders with a restriction on specific types and quantities. Food packages should have clear and non-removable labels that include the names of stakeholders except for the food which passengers bring. Imported food should enclose documents issued by the carrier in the country of origin. The documents must have full details of the imported foods .

eSignature and digital certification,"What is an eSignature? An eSignature is used in electronic messages to identify the signatory (the sender of the message) and distinguish them from everyone else. An eSignature also proves that the message received is the same message that was sent by the signatory and that nothing has been added, deleted or amended. It may consist of letters, marks, symbols, numbers, sounds or images. An eSignature is as binding as a signature executed by hand. Federal Decree by Law No. 46 of 2021 on Electronic Transactions and Trust Services (PDF, 4.4 MB, available in Arabic only) approves the use of eSignatures in the UAE. To create an eSignature, you need an electronic signature creation device, and a digital certificate to be authorised to use this device. Certification services providers issue digital certificates. These certificates confirm the identity of the signature device holder. What is a digital certificate? A digital certificate is a certificate issued by a certification service provider, which confirms the identity of the person or entity holding an electronic signature creation device. An electronic signature creation device is a uniquely configured device or electronic information that enables a person to apply his e-signature in the form of electronic keys and symbols. What is a digital certification service provider (DCSP)? A digital certification service provider is an accredited or authorised natural person or legal entity that issues digital certificates and offers digital signature-related services. How to apply for a DCSP license? You can apply for a DCSP license through Telecommunications and Digital Government Regulatory Authority (TDRA). Obtaining a licence from TRA is required for all digital certificate service providers operating in the UAE with respect to eRecords, eDocuments and eSignatures related to eTransactions and/or eCommerce . To apply for a DCSP licence, you need to submit the following documents to TRA: 
1) your company’s memorandum and Articles of Association 
2) details of your company’s organisational and ownership structure 
3) the commercial licence authorising you to act as a DCSP 
4) a statement of your commercial activities 
5) details of the company's accounts and financial resources for the previous two years (or less if your company has been trading for less than two years) 
6) an insurance policy which shows you have sufficient cover for your activities as a DCSP. 
 Digital signature and timestamp service Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs & Port Security (ICP) offers digital signature and timestamp service . The service enables entities and individuals to sign documents and transactions digitally using their ID card, with a timestamp on the signature that shows the date and exact time of the signature. The timestamp cannot be changed or altered even by the owner of the digital signature which gives undisputed accuracy of document and transaction creation and updates. ICP Validation Gateway-VG To simplify the usage of the Emirates ID card and its certificates, ICP set up a Validation Gateway  ( VG). VG enables governments, organisations as well as individuals to make use of the Emirates ID card in an online scenario.

Out of this, AED 21.662 billion (equivalent to 36.76 per cent) was allocated to the government affairs sector, which includes the development of the digital government."
Introducing the general budget,"The general budget is the financial programme of the federal governmen t used to achieve economic and social development. This is accomplished through the optimal distribution and efficient use of resources within the framework of the federal strategy on the expected spending by federal authorities during the coming fiscal year, provided that income and expenditure are balanced. According to the Federal Decretal Law No. 26 of 2019 on Public Finance, a separate budget for federal service authorities may be earmarked and submitted to Ministry of Finance (MoF) for approval. Also, all federal authorities may, by virtue of a Cabinet resolution, be assigned to prepare a draft medium-term budget. The Cabinet resolution shall determine the budget’s terms in years provided that it includes annual estimates for both income and expenditure, as approved by the Cabinet."
Issuing the budget law,"Every year during the third month of the fiscal year, Minister of Finance issues a circular containing steps for the preparation of the draft budget for the following year. The circular includes budget cap, approved strategic objectives, indicators, revenue forecast and a fixed deadline for submitting a draft budget to move. Each federal authority determines its programmes, plans and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) according to the strategic plan approved by the Cabinet within the budget cap. All authorities must also submit their initial forecasts for revenue and expenses allocated to chapters, line items, programmes and activities agreed upon, along with performance measures and efficiency indicators according to the circular issued by the minister, which specifies submission deadline. The fiscal year is composed of 12 months, starting from 1st January and ending on 31st December of each year."
Budget cycle,"The federal budget follows a medium-term budget cycle. The budget cycle must match the strategy cycle of the federal budget. A budget is drawn up for each year within the fiscal period, before the start of the period, and is updated annually within the budget cycle. This principle ensures that the long-term government strategy is reflected in the budget on a consistent basis. The federal budget cycle was developed from a three-year to a five-year budget cycle. Budget development In the last 49 years, the UAE’s budget has increased more than 291-fold from AED 200 million in 1972 to AED 58.3 billion in 2021. This has been accomplished through optimal distribution, efficient use of resources, and maintaining a balance between revenue and expenditures. *Source: Ministry of Finance Useful links:

2) The second phase targets a reduction of 63 per cent by 2040 
3) In the third phase, emissions reduction is expected to reach 93 per cent by 2050. 
 In the roadmap, there are separate decarbonization timelines for different hard-to-abate sectors, such as iron, steel, aluminium, cement and petrochemicals. The roadmap indicates that carbon capture, utilisation and storage, and clean electricity and efficiency enhancements alone could be responsible for a carbon reduction of 70 per cent by 2050. The action plan set out in the roadmap will cut 90 million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually. Read related news coverage ."

Artificial Intelligence Operating System (AIOS) for decarbonisation,"Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) developed the ‘ Artificial Intelligence Operating System’ (AIOS) to reduce the high cost of artificial intelligence (AI) programmes by decreasing the amount of energy that is spent in their development. The AIOS aims to support data centres at MBZUAI and in the UAE with the ability to enter ‘eco-mode’ for AI training and reduce energy waste. Current AI computing is extremely environmentally unfriendly. For example, training GPT3 once can cost as much energy as the home electricity usage of a small city (150,000 homes) and millions of dollars. The AIOS technology will reduce the energy and time required for AI computing by making models smaller, faster, and less reliant on high-end hardware, while also making them more performant and easier to adapt to changing environments and users. The AIOS can form the foundation of next-generation AI software production via automatic code generation, federated and collaborative machine learning, and standardised and certifiable software engineering, which will be used across industries such as energy, agriculture, water and food, and more.

Topography,"The UAE is largely an arid land with vast sand deserts, but is also characterised by sand dunes, oases, rock mountains, valleys, marshes and mangroves and salt plains. The oases are mostly of date palms; most oases are located in the emirate of Abu Dhabi. Along the eastern borders are the Hajjar Mountains that run north-south. These mountains are complemented by valleys (called wadis in Arabic). The wadis are usually dry. However, in cooler months when it rains, they flourish with brooks and pools. Mangroves (called qurms in Arabic) form an integral part of the marine ecosystem. Salt plains (called sabkhas in Arabic) are also a common feature. The present-day sabkha started to form some 4000 years ago."
Ecosystems,"The UAE's natural environment is diverse with four major varieties of ecosystems: 
1) desert ecosystem 
2) mountain ecosystem 
3) coastal and marine ecosystem 
4) Wetlands ecosystem. 
 Desert ecosystem Desert is the dominating landscape, stretching from the southern coast of Arabian Gulf to the uninhabited sands of the Empty Quarter (Rub Al Khali). To the east is the gravel plains bordering the  Hajjar Mountains. Mountains ecosystem Hajjar's rugged mountains rise sharply to an elevation of 2000 metres. Wadis or dry riverbeds open out onto fertile plains. Coastal and marine ecosystem The UAE's seas are home to a variety of fish, invertebrates and other marine animals. The southwest waters of Abu Dhabi and Marawah Marine Biosphere Reserve in Abu Dhabi, Jebel Ali in Dubai and Sir Bu Na'air Island and Khor Kalba in Sharjah are recognised by the UAE for their rich and unique environmental biodiversity and are of global biological and ecological importance. The marine habitat protects beaches from coastal erosion and plays a role in climate change mitigation. Natural habitats of marine organisms are governed mostly by the type of surface, tides, water current, degree of wave exposure, temperature and salinity. The marine life of the UAE is rich in fish, plants and corals. Over 500 different species of fish inhabit the Gulf waters, with many more existing in the Indian Ocean. The Arabian Gulf is blessed with large populations of dugongs, dolphins (eight species) and marine turtles. The green turtle (Chelonia mydas) is the most common and feeds on the extensive sea grass beds found in shallow waters. Both green and hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) turtles are known to nest on the beaches of UAE's main coast and islands. Coral reefs and mangrove creeks are habitats for many marine creatures. These areas are important fish breeding grounds and feeding areas and they protect the shores from coastal erosion. Damage to coastal developments, fishing nets, anchors and ignorant divers cause destruction of these areas. Coral reefs are sensitive to their environment. They take decades to regrow. Dominant marine life forms in the UAE coasts include fish, marine mammals and marine reptiles. Fish At the entrance to the Arabian Gulf, the constriction and resultant strong currents of the Strait of Hormuz, influence the distribution of many species. Marine mammals Marine mammals are relatively common in the UAE's waters and include a great diversity. The two groups of marine mammals that are represented here are the whales and dolphins of the order Cetacea, and  dugong  of the order Sirenia. Marine reptiles These include sea turtles and sea snakes. Sea turtles Of the seven recognised species of marine turtles in the world, four live in the waters of the UAE. They are: 
1) The  green turtle  (Chelonia mydas) 
2) The  hawksbill turtle  (Eretmochelys imbricata) 
3) The  loggerhead turtle  (Caretta caretta) 
4) The huge  leatherback turtle  (Dermochelys coriacea) 
5) The olive ridley sea turtle ( L epidochelys olivacea) 
 Sea Snakes Sea Snakes are found in the UAE's seas. There are at least seven species, all of which belong to one family, the Hydrophiidae. They are excellent swimmers and the laterally flattened tail makes them easily recognisable and distinguishes them from eels. Sourced from:

 The UAE's coasts The UAE has two coastlines. The longer coast, at over 700 kilometres, excluding islands, faces in a north to north-westerly direction into the southern Arabian Gulf whilst the other, much shorter, coast, approximately 70 kilometres long, faces eastwards into the Gulf of Oman. Much of the Arabian Gulf coastline is low-lying, flat and bordered by shallow water. While the coast of Gulf of Oman is rugged and eroding, with a higher proportion of hard rock. The differences in climate along the two coasts has led to assemblages of marine organisms that are somewhat different, although both are of Indian Ocean origin. Wetlands The UAE has 10 sites designated as Wetlands of International Importance , Ramsar sites, with a surface area of 39,166 hectares. Some of these are: 
1) Al Wathba Wetland Reserve, Abu Dhabi 
2) Bul Syayeef, Abu Dhabi 
3) Jebel Ali Wetland Sanctuary, Dubai 
4) Ras Al Khor Wildlife Sanctuary, Dubai 
5) Mangrove and Alhafeya Protected Area in Khor Kalba, Sharjah

Preserving plants' species,"Gheras In order to preserve its biodiversity and protect and restore the natural habitats of its local plants, the UAE created a database of local plant species and made it available to the public. . An app titled Gherasuae is available on App Store and Google Play . In 2014, the UAE's Ministry of Climate Change and Environment  completed the first phase  of its date palm tree identification through DNA profiling through a collaboration with the UAE University. The projects aims to offer all kinds of support to preserve, identify and classify all genetic assets of date palm trees. It also aims to establish a reference database for all types of palm trees found in the UAE, as well as identify and document the extent of their diversity. The project will also help increase the contribution of palm tree planting and date production to the country's gross domestic product. In addition, many initiatives were launched to preserve the UAE's plant species, including the establishment of 'gene' banks for plants' genetic resources. One initiative will be implemented by Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi (EAD), which is set to document and preserve plants through establishing Abu Dhabi Plant Genetics Resources Centre. The purpose of the centre is to collect and document native plants so that if any species became extinct in the wild it could be cultivated in captivity and reintroduced back to nature. The other is being undertaken at the UAE University in collaboration with the Khalifa Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology. Sourced from:

Rising demand for energy,"The energy sector plays an important role in shaping the UAE's internal and external policies. Since the discovery of oil and gas more than half a century ago, the UAE became a central player in global hydrocarbon energy market. The UAE is the fifth largest oil producer in OPEC, with an oil output of 2.79 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2013. In the same year, the production of natural gas amounted to around 54.60 billion cubic metres. The demand for electricity and water continues to grow at a fast pace due to a rise in population, an expanding economy and climatic considerations.According to The UAE State of Energy Report 2015 (PDF), the share of power generation from gas will drop from 98 per cent in 2012 to less than 76 per cent in 2021 as clean energy would enter the mix and energy efficiency would intensify. The UAE has decided to diversify its energy mix in order to sustain its progress and at the same time minimise the environmental impact that may arise from burning fuel.Therefore, it was decided that the traditional sources of energy, being oil and gas should not be the main drivers of the economic process. In addition, the UAE is developing local expertise in these important technologies and fostering international cooperation and resource conservation. While oil and gas have historically been the dominant fuels powering the UAE's economy, the UAE's energy sector is undergoing a transformation targeting the diversification of the UAE's energy mix. The UAE generates most of its electricity (110 billion kilowatt-hours in 2013) using natural gas-fired generation. It is planning to integrate the natural gas distribution networks of all the emirates; this should help alleviate some of the peak-demand shortfalls experienced in the past. In 2012, the total installed capacity of electricity generation was 27.2 gigawatts (GW). To meet the rising demand in a sustainable manner, the UAE is focusing on coming up with a balanced energy mix."
Clean energy-mix in the UAE,"The UAE Energy Strategy 2050 - (PDF, 67.9 MB)  targets an energy mix that combines renewable, nuclear and clean energy sources to meet the UAE’s economic requirements and environmental goals as follows: 
1) 44 per cent clean energy 
2) 38 per cent gas 
3) 12 per cent clean coal 
4) 6 per cent nuclear. 
 The UAE government aims to invest AED 600 billion by 2050 to meet the growing energy demand and ensure a sustainable growth for the country’s economy."
Energy Trilemma Index,"The Energy Trilemma Index ranks countries in terms of their potential ability to provide sustainable energy through the three dimensions: 
1) Energy security 
2) Energy equity 
3) Environmental sustainability 
 In 2017, the overall rank of the UAE in this index was 40 and the balance score was AAD. The UAE scored 21 in energy security, 14 in energy equity and 116 in environmental sustainability. Read more about the UAE's performance in Energy Trilemma Index ."

Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) project,"As part of Dubai Clean Energy Strategy to generate 75 per cent of Dubai's power from clean energy by 2050, Dubai will build the largest Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) project on a single site in the world, which is expected to begin power generation within the next five years. The project will surpass the existing world's largest CSP tower in Morocco that has a power generating capacity of 150MW. The new CSP project, will deliver inexpensive power at less than 8 US cents per kilowatt-hour as it is generated from the site to be located at the existing Mohammad Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park. Circular rings of solar mirrors called heliostats will direct sunlight into a central collection tower where the sun’s rays would power a steam turbine to generate concentrated solar power. The solar project and solar park when completed are expected to slash carbon emissions in Dubai by more than 6.5 million tonnes of harmful CO2, helping Dubai and the UAE meet their commitment to the Paris Agreement to keep global warming temperature increases below 2 degrees Celsius this century. The benefit of using concentrated solar power is that it can be stored for 8 to 12 hours after generation, which can help power the emirate through the night. The first phase of the new CSP project should be operational by 2021. Sourced from:

UAE Policy on nuclear energy,"The UAE government envisions to use nuclear power as the main source for generating non-hydrocarbon based electricity. The UAE instituted a comprehensive civil nuclear energy programme under the direct supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency. In 2008, the UAE published its policy on the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The policy is built on the most exacting standards of safety, transparency and security, making the UAE, a role model for nuclear energy development worldwide. To meet the ambitious milestones set by the UAE's nuclear energy policy, the Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) was established in 2009. Since 2012, the UAE has reached agreements with at least three countries (Argentina, Japan and Russia) on cooperation in the nuclear power sector. In addition, the UAE signed a nuclear cooperation agreement with the United States in 2009 and it is a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ."
Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant,"The UAE is currently building four units at the Barakah Nuclear Power Plant, and the project’s overall completion rate as of June 2022 is more than 97 per cent. The construction of the plant commenced in July 2012. The Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant is located in Al Dhafra of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, approximately 53 km west-southwest of the city of Ruwais. When all four units of the plant start operating commercially, the plant will produce up to 25 per cent of the country's electricity requirements. It will also prevent the release of 21 million tonnes of carbon emissions every year; this is equivalent to the removal of 3.2 million cars from the UAE’s roads annually. The completion rate of the individual units  are as follows: 
1) Unit 1 - operational 
2) Unit 2 - operational 
3) Unit 3 - commissioning phase 
4) Unit 4 - 92 per cent. 
 Unit 1 of Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant On 17 February 2020, FANR issued the operating license for Unit 1 of the Barakah Nuclear Power Plant to the Nawah Energy Company (Nawah), the Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation’s (ENEC ) subsidiary responsible for operation of the nuclear power plant located in Al Dhafra region of Abu Dhabi Emirate.

Wind energy,"The region's first wind turbine was installed on Sir Bani Yas Island. The wind turbine, which stands 65 metres high and has three rotor blades each with a 52-metre wingspan, has a production capacity of 850 kilowatts per hour. Masdar and Abu Dhabi's Tourism Development and Investment Company (TDIC) aim to develop an onshore wind farm on this island with a capacity of up to 30 MW."
Waste-to-energy,"Waste-to-energy is the process of generating energy in the form of electricity or heat from the primary treatment of waste. Masdar, Abu Dhabi's renewable energy company, had signed a strategic partnership agreement with Bee'ah  to develop the UAE's waste-to-energy (WtE) sector. This partnership will help contribute to the UAE Government's Vision 2021 which targets, among other goals, diverting waste from landfills by 75 per cent by 2021. In Abu Dhabi A 100 MW facility, one of the world's largest, is under development in  Abu Dhabi by Abu Dhabi National Energy  Company PJSC (Taqa) , in coordination with Abu Dhabi Waste Management Center (Tadweer). The plant was scheduled to be up and running by 2017, generating enough power for 20,000 households in Abu Dhabi as well as cutting greenhouse gases. It is expected to reduce CO2 emissions by more than one million ton per year. The project will be set near the Mussafah Sea Port, and it will be one of the biggest waste-to-energy facilities in the world, stretching across an area of 100,000 square metres. In Dubai By the second quarter of 2020, Dubai will have the largest plant in the Middle East to convert waste-to-energy. The plant will be located in Al Warsan 2 and will be built at a cost of AED 2 billion. The project is in line with Dubai Municipality's vision to make Dubai the most sustainable and smart city by 2021, which will in turn achieve National Agenda's objectives for a 75 per cent reduction in the number of landfills by 2021. This will provide more land plots that are currently being used to store waste, in addition to protecting the environment from methane emitted by landfills. The plant will begin its operations by the second quarter of 2020, and that it will be able to process 2,000 metric tonnes every day during the first phase of operations, producing 60 megawatts of energy. Dubai Municipality, in co-ordination with the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy and Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, conducts studies to achieve the strategy of Dubai for Clean Energy, to produce 7 per cent of Dubai's total energy from clean energy sources by 2020. In Sharjah The emirate of Sharjah set up a municipal waste management company Bee'ah (the Arabic word for environment) in 2007 in the form of a public-private partnership. In October 2011, Sharjah announced an ambitious plan for 100 per cent landfill diversion by 2015. To attain this goal, Bee'ah developed a state-of-the-art waste management centre to process and recycle waste. In 2012, the company introduced two-stream waste collection and a new tipping fee structure to incentivise waste reduction and to closely regulate landfill contents. Improved blue and green coloured odour-proof bins have been deployed across the emirate. In addition, Sharjah is constructing a Waste-to-Energy (WtE) plant in in Sajja area that will eventually convert 400,000 tonnes of waste per year into 80 megawatts (MW) of electricity. The project will convert 99 per cent of organic waste into energy. After using some of the generated power for the plant's own needs, the electricity will be exported to Sharjah. In Ras Al Khaimah The Energy from Waste Program of the RAK Energy Efficiency and Renewables Strategy 2040 integrates seamlessly into the broader waste management strategy of Ras Al Khaimah. It focuses on promoting energy outcomes for the available waste, targeting at least 2% of the primary energy demand of Ras Al Khaimah to be fulfilled from waste by 2040. The Energy from Waste Program is planned in two phases: 1) An initial phase of studies and pilots (2018 – 2020), when various diversion options and energy outcomes are explored for different waste streams and the best options are selected 2) A subsequent phase of implementation (2021 onwards), when the waste treatment options selected in the first phase are implemented.

Need for energy efficiency,"There are many reasons behind the increasing interest in achieving energy efficiency and rationalisation. Some of them are: 
1) climate change and the desire to reduce emissions 
2) the tendency to shift towards a green economy capable of creating new job opportunities 
3) the desire to achieve global economic competitiveness and to provide more sustainable products and services 
4) the increased demand for conventional energy sources and their rising prices 
5) the negative effects of using fossil fuels to produce electricity. 
 Some of the factors that lead to the prevention of energy efficiency among consumers are: 
1) lack of motivation of owners and tenants to spend money on the property to develop its energy efficiency 
2) low consumption cost. 
 The above equation requires careful revision of the consumption tariff from time to time, or to apply the slab tariff system. The slab tariff encourages consumers to stay within the scope of the least costly slab rather than increasing consumption to avoid the more expensive slabs. In order to promote efficient consumption of electricity and water, an additional fuel fee is added to consumers' monthly electricity and water bill. This fee depends on the rate of increase or decrease of the actual fuel cost supplied to DEWA's generation plants. Efficiency standards and specifications require an increase in capital expenditure to cover the sums required to purchase applications or introduce improvements that help to reduce consumption.

"Energy efficiency, conservation","At the federal level In July 2014, Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure established a new department for energy conservation and energy efficiency. One of the goals of this department is to establish a database of energy consumption by different sectors across the UAE, which allows comparisons between performance of establishments within a sector. The UAE  promotes the use of efficient electrical equipment. It launched an efficiency-labelling scheme for window and split-unit air-conditioning systems, eliminating highly inefficient units from the market. Since July 2014, the UAE has also banned the import of inefficient incandescent light bulbs. The scheme is expected to cut energy use by 500MW per year. National conservation campaign: Under the theme, ‘Save to sustain’ MOEI launched the National Energy Conservation campaign to raise the public awareness and knowledge of electricity and water conservation. The campaign targets students, families, employees, workers and tourists. It focuses on energy efficiency on buildings, transport, manufacturing and  agriculture sectors .  Read more about the National conservation campaign (PDF, 980 KB) At the local level In Dubai, H. H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, issued a resolution to implement green building specifications and standards (PDF) in new buildings. In 2014, the building code became mandatory for all new buildings in the emirate. Sharjah Electricity, Water and Gas Authority (SEWGA) created a unit called Conservation Department with a target to conserve electricity, water and gas. In  Ajman, Green Building committee  in Ajman Municipality and Planning Department was formed to support energy conservation efforts. In Ras Al Khaimah, Barjeel, the Green Building Regulations of the emirate issued by Ras Al Khaimah Municipality sets minimum sustainability standards for new buildings. Buildings permitted under Barjeel are expected to consume 30% less energy and water as compared to a typical building in Ras Al Khaimah. Barjeel is now mandatory for all new buildings starting from January 2020 following a one-year voluntary period. In 2010, the UAE Cabinet approved the Green Building and Sustainable Building standards to be applied across the country. Application of these standards started at government buildings early 2011. The project is expected to save AED 10 billion by 2030 and reduce around 30 per cent of carbon emissions. Emirates Energy Star (EES) is a joint venture between Etisalat and Pacific Controls to reduce the GHG emissions of the UAE and the fuel bills of its companies, by retrofitting existing buildings with energy saving controls systems and achieving savings of 10-35 per cent. The programme is working successfully with all types of legacy systems, ranging from buildings with or without building management system (BMS), facilities with chilled water systems and those with package units. It is tailored to suit individual building owner's financial requirements. EES' rating system Emirates Energy Star assigns stars on the basis of percentage of energy saving. Refer to the chart below for stars: 
1) 10 per cent energy saving (1 star)

Efforts to secure energy sources,"The UAE Government's efforts to secure its energy sources include: The Dolphin energy project Gas provides over 90 percent of electricity generation and despite the fact that the UAE's natural gas reserves have been estimated as the 5th largest in the world, the UAE has been importing gas since 2007. The country receives approximately 2 billion cubic feet of gas per day ( as of 2011 ) through the Dolphin Energy pipeline from Qatar. Dubai has a facility to import three million tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) per year. Another import facility is expected to be built in Fujairah with an import capacity of 9 million tonnes. Exploring indigenous gas reserves The UAE is also exploring indigenous gas reserves, such as sour gas resources projects undertaken by Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC). Establishing the Emirates National Grid (ENG) Read about the Emirates National Grid project . Contributing to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Interconnection Grid The UAE's ENG project coincides with the development of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Interconnection Grid that will link Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE under one regional grid. The UAE contributed AED 800 million to the AED 5.1-billion project ( as of 2011 ) to build regional power grid, which is expected to save the participating countries up to AED 18.4 billion (USD 5 billion) in electricity costs over its lifetime and will lay the foundation for a common GCC energy market."
Usage and demand,"According to UAE State of Energy Report 2015 , residents use about 550 litres of water and 20 to 30 kilowatt-hours of electricity a day and as the economy grows, the demand for energy is expected to increase by 9 per cent annually. Electricity demand in the UAE had reached 105 billion kilowatt hours in 2013, placing the UAE among the highest electricity consumers per capita in the world. The demand for electric power was matched by an increase in the number of power plants and their installed capacities. The installed capacities of power plants had increased by 54 per cent during 2007-2012. On 2 March 2011, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed had announced an investment of AED 5.7 billion to the water and electricity sector in the northern areas of the country. He directed the Department of Energy in Abu Dhabi  to export electricity and water to Etihad  Water and Electricity , who in turn would supply the same to the northern areas of the UAE. Electricity and water exported by Abu Dhabi doubled from 2008 to reach 13.664 gigawatt hours of exports. Between 2008 and 2012, electricity capacity grew by 37 per cent, with Dubai increasing capacity by 44.5 percent and Abu Dhabi by 43.6 per cent. In 2012, the total installed capacity reached 27,180 megawatts. At present, there are over 27 gigawatts (GW) of installed capacity to generate electricity across the seven emirates utilising natural gas, which is the cleanest fossil fuel available. The UAE is looking at increasing its target for generating power from clean energy to 27 per cent by 2021."
National Grid project,"Rapid economic and demographic growth over the past decade pushed the UAE's electricity grid to its limits. Installed fossil fuel generating capacity, which accounts for nearly all of the UAE's capacity continues to rise, reaching more than 27 gigawatts (GW) in 2013, according to Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Authority. State-led entities manage the domestic electricity grid in each of the seven emirates, but the UAE is making progress toward integrating the emirates into a more efficient  national grid. The Emirates National Grid project aims to interconnect the following four authorities that are responsible for supplying power throughout the emirates: 
1) Etihad  Water and Electricity 
2) Department of Energy - Abu Dhabi 
3) Dubai Electricity and Water Authority ( DEWA) 
4) Sharjah Electricity, Water and Gas Authority ( SEWGA). 
 One of the main advantages of the  ENG project  is the financial savings as a result of the reduction in installed reserve capacity on each of the individual utility systems. It also enables the commercial transfer of electricity between the power authorities. The ENG interconnected system also provides a stronger capacity to withstand major or sudden disturbances, such as the loss of production units and failure of grid elements, whether due to outages or natural catastrophes, as well as several types of crises.

The National Water and Energy Demand Management Programme targets 40 per cent efficiency of the three most energy-consuming sectors in the UAE : transport, industry and construction. The programme includes three main pillars : Energy, water and consumption rationalisation."
Desalination plants,"The UAE has limited natural water resources. It uses thermal desalination as the dominant technology to make seawater potable. Today, most of the country's potable water (42 per cent of the total water requirement) comes from some 70 major desalination plants, which account for around 14 per cent of the world's total production of desalinated water. Due to lack of freshwater sources, it is important for the UAE to identify a sustainable desalination solution to meet long-term water needs. Connecting desalination technologies to renewable energy is one solution. The water consumed in the UAE is mainly desalinated, dependent on electricity in case of reverse osmosis, or a by-product of electricity generation through multiple-effect distillation (MED) and multiple-stage flash distillation (MSF). According to State of Energy Report 2015, the demand for water grew largely at a rate of 35.8 percent from 2008 to 2012. The installed capacity for desalinated and groundwater reached 1,585 million imperial gallons per day, while water production was 393,878 million imperial gallons per year. Some of the desalination plants in the UAE include: 
1) Shuweihat S2 power and water plant in Abu Dhabi: It has a production capacity of 1510 Mega Watt (MW) of electricity and 100 Million Imperial Gallons (MIGD) of water per day 
2) Jebel Ali power station in Dubai: It is the largest power and desalination plant in the UAE, with six gas turbines capable of producing 2060 MW and 140 MIGD of water. 
3) F2 Plant in Fujairah: It is a greenfield power generation and seawater desalination plant with 2850 MW of power capacity and 230 MIGD of water. 
"
Dams,"The UAE has paid great attention to dams and rainwater harvesting projects. Dams contribute to protection from floods and flow risks and improve the quality and quantity of the water situation in the aquifer by increasing the feeding rates of groundwater. Dams in the UAE include: 
1) Wadi Al Beeh dam (Length: 575 metres, height: 18 metres)

Supporting global efforts to provide potable water,"The UAE saves no effort in expanding international cooperation and capacity-building support to developing countries in water and sanitation-related activities and programmes, including water harvesting, desalination, water efficiency, wastewater treatment, recycling and reuse technologies. The Mohamed bin Zayed Water initiative aims to confront the urgent challenge of water scarcity around the world. It also aims to enhance awareness of the severity of the crisis of water scarcity and accelerate the pace of technological innovation to deal with the challenges it poses Suqia - UAE Water Aid  is a non-profit organisation established to support international efforts to provide potable clean water to people in need around the world and to contribute to finding permanent, sustainable and innovative solutions to water scarcity. The UAE Water Aid Foundation also conducts studies and researches in coordination and partnership with educational, academic, and international organisations to support water production using solar power, and contributes to financing and supporting water-technology projects to combat drought. The ‘Suqia’ campaign was launched to provide access to fresh drinking water for 5 million people around the world. The campaign, which was supervised by the UAE Red Crescent, received an overwhelming response and was a remarkable success. It surpassed its targets, collecting over AED180 million in 18 days, which is enough to provide water to over 7 million people around the world."
Efforts to manage waste,"Due to population growth and economic activities, the quantities of wastes in the UAE have increased in the last decade. Most of the waste ends up in municipal landfills or dumpsites, where organic waste generates a large amount of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Currently, little of the waste is burnt and the rate of municipal waste recycling has been rapidly rising. Waste management in the country is coordinated through local authorities. Waste issues are handled through recycling and converting waste to energy and resources, new technologies and improved waste separation and collection systems. The UAE aims to reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management. The UAE issued Cabinet Resolution No. (39) regarding the executive regulations of Federal Resolution No. (12) of 2018  on the integrated waste management that seeks to regulate the waste management process and standardize the mechanisms and methods of proper waste disposal in line with best practices with the aim of protecting the environment and reducing risks to human health. Waste management in Abu Dhabi The Government of Abu Dhabi established the Centre of Waste Management Tadweer in 2008.  The company is responsible for the policy, strategy and contractual systems of waste management across the emirate. Waste management in Dubai Dubai Municipality's Waste Management Department prepared the Dubai Integrated Waste Management Master Plan in 2012 with an aim to reduce the amount of waste being sent to the landfills to zero in 20 years by using an integrated and innovative approach. Dubai Municipality has announced that it will establish the largest plant in the Middle East to convert solid waste into energy at a cost of AED 2 billion in the Warsan district. The move also comes in line with the National Agenda to reduce the landfill by 75 per cent by 2021, in addition to protecting the environment from methane gas emitted by the landfill. The implementation period will take three years and the plant will be operational in the second quarter of 2020 during which it will receive 2,000 metric tonnes of municipal solid waste per day in the first phase to produce 60 megawatts. The waste incineration project is the first of the four projects to produce green energy. Dubai Municipality, in co-ordination with Dubai Supreme Council of Energy and Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, conducted studies to achieve the strategy of Dubai for Clean Energy, to produce 7 per cent of Dubai's total energy from clean energy sources by 2020. Waste management in Sharjah The emirate of Sharjah set up a municipal waste management company Bee'ah (the Arabic word for environment) in 2007 in the form of a public-private partnership. In October 2011, Sharjah announced an ambitious plan for 100 per cent landfill diversion by 2015. To attain this goal, Bee'ah developed a state-of-the-art waste management centre to process and recycle waste. In 2012, the company introduced two-stream waste collection and a new tipping fee structure to incentivise waste reduction and to closely regulate landfill contents. Improved blue and green coloured, odour-proof bins have been deployed across the emirate."

The first phase of the NFPC facility with energy and water saving features will comprise a 5-gallon water bottling plant, a dairy, a juice and small water bottling plant under one roof. The second phase of the project will comprise a fully automated packaging factory producing tailored containers for the food industry, a modern recycling plant to manufacture products using waste materials and the largest fully automated cold store. Dubai Aluminium (Dubal) and  Emirates Aluminium (Emal), which were merged into Emirates Global Aluminium (EGA) in 2013, introduced a co-generation and combined cycle configuration in their power stations, achieving 46-48 per cent thermal efficiency. According to UAE State of Green Economy Report 2014 , Dubai's greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity in production was reduced by 12 per cent in five years. The UAE aims to upgrade infrastructure and make industries sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes."
Cleaner fuels,"Natural gas is a viable cleaner alternative fuel to gasoline as it produces fewer emissions and the running cost of vehicles is around 30 per cent less. ADNOC's gas processing and fuel distribution subsidiaries are leading the way to expand the use of the compressed natural gas (CNG) for vehicles by investing in the infrastructure to ensure that there are enough filling stations to support additional demand for such vehicles. The first phase of the Natural Gas for Vehicles (NGV) project involves the installation of CNG pumps at 16 stations in Abu Dhabi and Al Ain as well as in the emirate of Sharjah, with a capacity to fill 10,000 vehicles per day. In Dubai, Emirates Gas (EMGAS), an ENOC subsidiary, started an initiative to popularise CNG as an automotive fuel in 2006. Moreover, more than 3,000 public transport vehicles have been adapted to run on CNG. In addition, a pilot project was conducted with Dubai's Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) that converted diesel-operated wooden abras (water taxis) running on the Dubai creek to operate on CNG. In addition, CNG is introduced to fleet users such as Dubai Municipality, DP World, Emirates Group, Transguard and Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) among others. Green diesel In July 2014, the UAE became the first country in the Middle East to make use of 'green diesel' in all commercial diesel vehicles mandatory. The new Cabinet decree and the updated guidelines from Emirates Authority for Standardization and Metrology (ESMA) requires replacement of the diesel fuel that contains 500 parts per million (ppm) of sulphur with diesel fuel that contains only 10 ppm similar to Euro 5 standards. This reduction in sulphur levels will significantly reduce particulate matters (PM) and pollutants and contribute to cleaner and healthier environment. Introducing green service stations ENOC introduced the first ' green service station' in the Emirates Hills neighbourhood in Dubai. This station applies a variety of state-of-the-art technologies and features including: 
1) Devices to contain petrol fumes released by the pump 
2) A system that segregates waste 
3) Waste bins that are colour-coded 
4) Furniture made from recycled materials 
5) A vacuum system that is centralised and supports power conservation, reduces waste and noise. 
 The station generates half of its energy requirements from renewable sources as it uses solar-powered pole and light-emitting diode (LED) lights. Diverse sustainable water features have been installed to reduce water use by a quarter. It uses sensor water taps and two-stage flush systems in the toilets and recycles carwash water while also providing customers the option to use a waterless carwash system with an all-in-one eco-friendly liquid. Clean fossil fuels Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a means of mitigating climate change by capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) from large point sources such as power plants and storing it safely underground instead of releasing it into the atmosphere. The potential impact of CCS is huge. The Intergovernmental Panel on climate change expects that CCS could contribute between 10 and 55 per cent of the cumulative worldwide carbon mitigation effort over the next 90 years. The UAE is developing a major CCS project in Abu Dhabi, which is managed by Al Reyadah: Abu Dhabi Carbon Capture Company. It is the first in a planned series of CCUS projects in the emirate of Abu Dhabi. The source of CO2 for this Project is an off stream from Emirates Steel Industries (ESI) factory in Mussafah, UAE."
Smart energy management,"Demand-side management (DSM) focuses on reducing and optimising energy consumption as an additional option to meet network demand. DSM activities generally comprise a portfolio of policies and programmes for improving energy efficiency and demand response. At the core of this demand-side approach is the introduction of smart metres that can provide more precise information about energy use and ensure faster responses to changing supply and demand through automatic reconnections. In Abu Dhabi, the Department of Energy launched a DSM programme defining a holistic energy efficiency strategy that ensures a shift towards the development of a smart grid that will support the future needs of the society. It has completed an implementation roadmap for the programme and has already made significant progress in rolling out advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) over 400,000 of the existing 680,000 consumer points in the municipalities of Abu Dhabi and Al Ain. AMI collects consumption data remotely via smart metres, which is validated and transferred through data management systems to its customer billing system. In Dubai, as the emirate set a target of 30 per cent reduction in energy demand by 2030 as a key objective of the Dubai Integrated Energy Strategy 2030, DEWA has developed a DSM roadmap and action plan over the short, medium and long-term to 2030. These include 8 DSM programmes and 24 initiatives covering all the potential saving areas and include cost-benefit analysis, implementation and financing mechanisms and measurement and verification methodology. In addition, DEWA replaced conventional metres with 200,000 smart metres all over Dubai."
Cooling systems,"The UAE is a leader in adopting district cooling systems (DCS) as the preferred alternative to conventional air conditioning. In general, DCS consume 50 per cent less energy than the conventional systems. A number of district cooling utility companies have emerged and more than one in ten residents now use the systems."
Green building codes,"In 2010, the UAE Cabinet approved the Green Building and Sustainable Building standards to be applied across the country. Application of these standards started in government buildings early 2011. The project is expected to save AED 10 billion by 2030 and reduce around 30 per cent of carbon emissions. Abu Dhabi introduced the five-level  Estidama  Pearl Rating System. It is mandatory for all new buildings to obtain a one-pearl rating, while all government buildings and residential villas must obtain two pearls. Dubai introduced the green building regulations containing 79 specifications, which is now mandatory for all developments."

Controlled medicines,"The UAE is a signatory to several international conventions on narcotic and psychotropic substances (PDF). The conventions involve applying internationally valid control measures to ensure that narcotic and psychotropic substances are not freely available to layman. The conventions aim to: 
1) make narcotic and psychotropic substances available only for medical and scientific purposes 
2) prevent their diversion into illicit channels 
3) eliminate drug trafficking and abuse. 
 Federal Law No. 14 of 1995 describes how these conventions are applied in the UAE and Federal Law No. 4 of 1983 describes the basic requirements for prescribing and supplying prescription medicines. Controlled drugs are those that, if not used responsibly, can lead to addiction and have the potential to be abused by individuals. Narcotic and psychotropic (controlled drug - Class A or CDa) drugs are controlled. Controlled medicines are administered to patients of acute and chronic diseases in accordance with modern medical practice. They are mostly administered to in-patients. Controlled drug - Class B (CDb) are semi-controlled. Majority of medicines which are used worldwide are available in community pharmacies and hospitals in the UAE. However, narcotic, psychotropic and other controlled drugs/medicines of class A or B are neither freely available in the UAE, nor can they be freely imported into the country. They fall under the controlled/restricted items' category. You may bring in other prescribed medicines for personal use in normal quantity. To import some medicines , you are required to receive permit from Ministry of Health and Prevention. Prescription of controlled medicines Narcotic prescriptions In the emirate of Abu Dhabi, a narcotic can be prescribed only by a physician licensed by HAAD for an in-patient and must be written on the approved narcotic prescription form. Private sector prescriptions for out-patient narcotic supply are not usually allowed. However, exceptions will be considered following a request from a medical director. Psychotropic prescriptions In the emirate of Abu Dhabi, a psychotropic for an out-patient can be prescribed only by a HAAD-licensed physician. There are special requirements for the psychotropics known as CDa, previously known as 'Registered Prescription (RP)' or 'Group 4' drugs. These must be prescribed on the official psychotropic prescription form. Currently, there are UAE federal restrictions on the duration of prescription supply of CDa and CDb drugs and this depends upon the status of the prescribing physician. In accordance with Federal Law No. 4 of 1983, there are special requirements for an out-patient prescription written for a CDa. There are no special prescription-requirements for ordering psychotropic CDb drugs for in or out-patients and therefore these are ordered using a normal medical prescription. By prohibiting the use of drugs and restricting the use of controlled medicines, the UAE aims to strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse.

In case the applicant provided false information or falsifying documents, the ministry has the right to stop the assistance and request for reimbursement of the amount given. The committee has the right to pay the assistance to the legal guardian, if it is proved that the beneficiary is not qualified to handle the assistance for any reason. The complete assistance amount is given to the beneficiary's family in case of his death."

Socio-economic empowerment,"Empowerment of women in the UAE had started in 8 February 1973 when the first women's meeting in the UAE, 'The Renaissance of Abu Dhabi Women Association' was held. The foundation of similar associations began in other emirates. Sheikha Fatima Bint Mubarak envisioned the need to cope with the unitary ideology of her husband, the late Sheikh Zayed who was the Founding Father of the UAE and established General Women's Union in 1975 joining all women associations in the UAE. Since then, the UAE has implemented a number of initiatives for the economic empowerment of women in the UAE. In December 2012, the Government issued a decision on the mandatory membership of Emirati women in the Boards of Directors of federal bodies, companies and institutions. Women in the workforce As of 2015, women occupy 66 per cent of public sector jobs , one of the highest proportions worldwide. 30 per cent occupy senior leadership positions associated with decision-making roles. Women in the UAE participate actively in the private sector in various roles including that of entrepreneurs and managers. According to another report published in November 2015 in WAM , there are 21,000 women employers in the UAE. Women in the UAE have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to ownership and control over land and other forms of property, financial services, inheritance and natural resources, in accordance with national laws. Women business-owners account for 10 per cent of the total private sector in the UAE. They run projects worth more than AED 40 billion and constitute 15 per cent of the members of the boards of directors of the Chambers of Commerce and Industry. National Strategy for Empowerment of Emirati Women On 8 March 2015, Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak, the Chairwoman of General Women's Union (GWU) launched the National Strategy for Empowerment of Emirati Women in the UAE for 2015-2021 (WAM). The strategy provides a framework for government, private sector and civil society organisations to establish work plans to position the UAE among the most advanced countries in the area of women's empowerment. The strategy contains four basic priorities: 
1) maintaining the sustainability of the Emirati women's achievements and continue achieving further gains 
2) maintaining the social fabric and cohesion through integrating the roles between men and women in order to build a strong and cohesive society able to cope with emerging changes 
3) providing a decent and safe social welfare based on high quality foundations for women 
4) developing the spirit of responsibility and strengthening the position of the UAE's women in regional and international fora.

National Strategy for Empowerment of Emirati Women,"On 8 March 2015, Her Highness Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak, Chairwoman of the General Women’s Union (GWU), Supreme Chairwoman of the Family Development Foundation (FDF) and President of the Supreme Council for Motherhood and Childhood, launched the National Strategy for Empowerment of Emirati Women in the UAE for the years 2015-2021. The strategy aims to provide a framework for all federal and local government entities, private sector, as well as social organisations, to set plans that will provide a decent living for women and make them creative in all sustainable and developmental fields. The current plan is an update to an earlier strategy launched by Sheikha Fatima in 2002. It is also seen as a fruit of the cooperation between GWU and other competent organisations at the federal and local levels and social organisations. The strategy is based on analyses of the policies and programmes implemented by various institutions working for women’s empowerment. Workshops were held to discuss the results with partner organisations.

The UAE’s youth sector,"The UAE Government sees young people as its greatest assets; the foundation of the country’s future. In 2016, H. H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Prime Minister and Vice President of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, committed to putting young people’s needs and desires at the fore, by creating the position of Minister of State for Youth Affairs – a dedicated post that showed the government’s confidence in young people’s capabilities. This enabled the youth to shoulder national responsibilities, innovate and contribute to the welfare of the UAE's community. To achieve its vi sion, the UAE needs the skills, energy, enthusiasm and commitment of the country's young people, and to do that, young people’s voices must be heard, their ideas taken on, and their recommendations implemented at all government levels. The government took seriously the potential advantages of harnessing the ‘youth bulge’ in the UAE and in the region, appointing one of the youngest ministers in the world, nominated by universities from across the country. To place a young person at the helm of such an important government department was a vote of confidence in this generation’s ability to lead effectively."
Interactive Youth Lab,"Interactive Youth Lab is an innovative initiative aimed at activating the role of youth and investing their creative potential in discovering solutions and ideas for the development of government initiatives and the work of the mGovernment sector. The lab aims to enhance the role of young people and their place in decision-making and policy development, all in an interactive way. Students of Khalifa University in Abu Dhabi, members of the Abu Dhabi Youth Council and a distinguished group of Emirati youth participated in this lab which was launched in February 2019 by Telecommunications and Digital Government Regulatory Authority (TDRA)."
Federal Youth Authority,"In 2018, Federal Youth Authority (FYA) was established. It was a startup initiative intended to connect every young person to every branch of government. It followed the principle of ‘Done by Youth, For Youth and With Youth’. This paved the way to make youth strategy and policy, a part of all public and private sectors."
The National Youth Strategy,"The UAE’s National Youth Strategy looks at the five major transitions in a youth’s life in a 20-year span. From ages 15-35, youth transition through these critical stages: FYA invests in youth’s energy, our most valuable resource, by nurturing their character , developing an enabling  environment for their growth and development, and maximising their participation . FYA uses the metaphor of a plant to illustrate their strategy: 
1) Character in young people is like the roots of a tree, it influences everything we do. Every action, attitude and belief we take is first rooted in our character. This means that the attitudes, beliefs and choices of our youth shape our nation and our world. Character matters the most. 
2) The UAE is on a mission to cultivate character in youth that builds on our core values of inclusion, tolerance, family and commitment to excellence. 
3) The stem of the plant is the enabling environment . We provide both, a tangible and intangible environment in terms of physical spaces and enabling government policies for youth. 
4) We believe that when we invest in youth, it is similar to watering the plants and providing them with sunlight and good soil. Youth will participate by sharing their talents and skills back into the country, which will build the foundation for the next 50 years of the UAE’s development. 
"
Policies for youth,"The UAE Government designed many policies to make the youth take part in every sector and at all levels of governance and decision-making, and to infuse them into the national strategy as key stakeholders and actors in the country’s development. Youth Engagement Policy The UAE’s mandate is to institutionalise the whole youth sector. The UAE has made big bets on youth and believes that engaging them is the fundamental component to success in the next 50 years of development. FYA is therefore part of spearheading the Engagement policy to include the voice of the youth in everything we do. Engaging youth means three core things: 
1) Engagement is listening 
2) Engagement is data capturing 
3) Engagement is purposeful, inclusive and puts youth and their input as the core of the country’s development strategy. 
 The UAE engages youth at regional (through the Arab Youth Centre), national and local levels. It engages its youth in all matters, and it can be evidenced in the policies and initiatives below. Emirati Youth Board Membership In June 2019, the UAE Cabinet made it mandatory for federal government entities to include young Emiratis (under 30 years old) in the Boards of Directors of their respective entities . It launched an electronic platform for those interested to register and apply to these boards, and on 3rd February 2020, Cabinet approved the appointment of 33 applicants as members of the Boards of Directors for key federal entities. The young board members serve two to three-year terms and undergo intensive training. They enjoy similar privileges and benefits as other established board members. The new members are expected to provide creative solutions for national issues and to ensure that youth are given opportunities and that their challenges are resolved at every level. Youth Councils In 2017, the UAE government developed Youth Councils as a unique tool to ensure that the youth represent their points of view and needs at all stages of the policy development process. Youth Councils were launched with an aim to nurture young leaders by giving them a key role in decision-making and in the development of policies and projects. They provide a platform for youth to lead projects in their field or their emirate. The ecosystem of the Youth Councils is crucial to implementing and executing the UAE’s National Youth Strategy. There are five Youth Councils which serve as the central form of volunteer governance over many of the Youth initiatives and points of engagement: ● Emirates Youth Council (EYC) ● Local Youth Councils (LYC) ● Global Youth Councils (GYC) ● Inter-Ministerial Councils (IMC) These function as the representative arms of youth across the UAE’s specific ministries. ● Corporate Councils These function as the representative arms of youth across the UAE’s private and public sector enterprises. Youth Participation in Official Delegations policy In February 2020, the UAE approved the 'Youth Participation in Official Delegations' policy, which ensures the representation of young employees in all UAE official delegations. Objectives: 
1) building leaders in the diplomatic field 
2) integrating a youth perspective into the UAE's international delegations 
3) activating the youth's role on a global scale 
4) designing a framework that supports youth representation 
5) Showcasing the character of UAE youth on the international scene 
6) promoting the UAE's soft power and highlighting the government's engagement with youth. 
 The Youth Housing Policy On 2 June 2020, the UAE Cabinet approved the Youth Housing Awareness Policy to raise youth awareness and provide them with a host of information on the various phases of housing construction. The policy requires all young applicants (from 18 to 35 years) to complete a training course on the foundations of housing construction as a main requirement to apply for housing assistance at the local and federal level in the UAE. Federal Youth Authority also developed a ‘ Housing 101 ’ course, which provides instructions on the how to build a house – from conception to construction. View the full list of Youth Policies ."
Youth Initiatives,"Youth Circles Designed by and for the youth, Youth Circles provide two-way dialogues directly between the youth and our government, private sector and global leaders. Youth Circles are affordable, accessible and fully community-led. Organised periodically throughout different global locations, the aim of Youth Circles is to develop practical solutions, innovative ideas and effective policies and tangibly connect Youth to leadership. In Youth Circles, youth share their ideas, needs, challenges and dreams. Leaders listen, hold a dialogue and take action. Each event addresses a specific topic and the young participants try to come up with solutions and ideas through discussions and recommendations. Youth Hubs Youth Hubs are state-of-the-art spaces done by the youth, for the youth. They are collaborative work and convening spaces that connect young people throughout the UAE with the essential resources and ecosystem for growth. The mission of Youth Hub is to provide world-class resources for the youth to explore their purpose in life and pursue their potential and thrive. Resources include both, facilities and courses in various skills designed to bring out their potential. Youth Hubs are located across all the UAE and are open to young people between 15 and 35 years irrespective of whether they are students, employees or entrepreneurs. The first Youth Hub opened in Dubai in September 2017 in order to connect youth in the areas of: 
1) job creation and economic growth 
2) education and lifelong learning 
3) innovation and entrepreneurship 
4) mentoring and partnerships and 
5) health and wellness. 
 There are currently 13 Youth Hubs around the UAE. Each Youth Hub is distinctly designed to serve the youth of that emirate, accommodating their needs and aspirations."
The UAE and Arab youth,"In 2017, the UAE launched the Arab Youth Center (AYC) during the World Government Summit 2017. AYC is a regional youth centre in the UAE that helps to develop youth capabilities and supports innovation and creativity in the Arab world. It implements initiatives across different sectors, and conducts research amongst young Arabs to help decision-makers shape youth-friendly policies. AYC runs over 25 initiatives every year, connecting the youth to industry professionals, opening doors for them in the academic world, helping them build their businesses and much more. For the ninth year in a row, the UAE is the Arab youth's first choice for living, according to the Arab Youth Survey 2020. The UAE recognises the importance of equipping not just its own youth, but also the youth within the region. The success of the region lies in its youth, and the UAE is working closely with young Arabs to make sure their contributions to their countries have a ripple effect across borders and well into the future."

Divorce laws for Muslim couples,"Islamic marriages are governed by the Sharia law. If both husband and wife are Muslims and residents in the UAE, Sharia/UAE law will most likely be applied to their divorce. The same is likely if the husband is a Muslim and the woman a non-Muslim."
Steps for filing a divorce in the UAE,"The first step is to register the case by either party at the Family Guidance Section at the respective judicial department, in one of the emirates. A court appointed conciliator will try to reconcile the divorcing parties. The conciliatory procedure is a mandatory process of the divorce proceedings in the UAE. Parties are allowed to raise their concerns pertaining to the marriage in the absence of their respective legal representatives. Amicable divorces can be concluded at this stage. Parties will need to draft a settlement based on the parties’ mutual understanding and sign it before the conciliator. If one of the parties or both of them are determined about the divorce, then the conciliator will provide the claimant with a referral letter, permitting them to proceed before the court to conclude their divorce case. The letter can be submitted to court at any time within three months from the date of issue. Once in court, the particulars of the divorce case fall at the court's discretion and each party has to provide evidence to support own claims against one another as well as in their own defence."
Divorce laws for non-Muslim couples,"Non-Muslim expatriate residents can file for divorce in their home country (domicile) or apply for divorce in the UAE. If the parties wish to have the law of their home country applied, they may petition for this before the court. Article 1 of the Federal Law No 28 of 2005 for Personal Affairs , as amended states: The provisions of this Law shall apply on citizens of the United Arab Emirates State unless non-Muslims among them have special provisions applicable to their community or confession. They shall equally apply to non-citizens unless one of them asks for the application of his law. This means that relevant parties may ask to apply their own laws to personal status matters. It also provides: The law of the state of which the husband is a national at the time the marriage is contracted shall apply to the effects on personal status and the effects with regards to property resulting from contracting of the marriage. Whenever the law of the parties' home country fails to cover an aspect of the divorce procedure, the courts hold discretion to apply the UAE law."
Children's custody,"According to  Federal Law No 28 of 2005 for Personal Affairs, the biological mother of the child is the custodian and the father is the guardian. Custody involves day-to-day care of the child, which is usually granted to the mother without interfering with the right of guardianship awarded to the father. At all times, the father is responsible for providing for the child financially. He is responsible for providing shelter, expenses for food, medical care, education and other necessities. Custody and guardianship are two separate issues that must be addressed individually as parents do not share equal responsibilities for a child in the UAE. The courts always act in the best interests of the child and therefore, unless given reason to believe otherwise, they keep him in the physical custody of the mother, whilst being under the guardian's (father's) supervision. Article 156 of  Federal Law No 28 of 2005 for Personal Affairs  provides that a child's custody under the mother ends when their son reaches the age of 11 and when their daughter reaches the age of 13. The father being the guardian can claim the custody thereafter. As set out in Article 143 and 144 of the law, a custodian must be: 
1) Rational 
2) Mature enough and have attained the age of puberty 
3) Honest 
4) Able to bring up and take care of a child 
5) Free from infectious disease 
6) Not have been sentenced for a crime of 'honour'. 
 If the custodian is the mother, she must: 
1) Not remarry unless the court decides it's in the best interests of the child 
2) Share the same religion as the child. 
 If the custodian is the father, he must: 
1) Have a suitable woman living in his home to care for the child (such as a female relative) 
2) Share the same religion as the child. 
 The mother also has the right to claim the extension of the custody period until their son finishes his education and their daughter gets married. In this case, the mother has to prove that she has been good with the children i.e. through their school performance reports, good medical health history etc. The father can claim the custody of their son if he feels that their son is becoming too soft in nature by staying with the mother and that he would want him to grow up to be more responsible. In both circumstances, the judge will decide the case."
Travel bans,"A custodian cannot travel with the child without the guardian's approval and vice-versa. Fleeing with the child without the consent of the other parent, could amount to child abduction. The parent abducting the child can face serious legal consequences for such action. If either parent has concerns, they can obtain a travel ban preventing the child from leaving the airport. If there is a dispute, the matter can be referred to a judge."
Death statistics,"According to Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Centre, in 2020 1,020 Emirati women and 1,374 Emirati men died bringing the total to 2,394 deaths. 1,655 expatriate women and 6,307 expatriate men died bringing the total to 7,963 deaths. Related links:

"
Reporting a death,"To report a death outside a hospital, immediately call the police on 999 (from anywhere in the UAE) and inform them about the incident. The police will fill out an initial death report and move the deceased to the government morgue. In case of death in a hospital, the authorities will fill out the initial death report and move the deceased to the government morgue. The authorities at the morgue will issue a death certificate declaration. The death certificate declaration will need to be stamped by the police after which they will issue a no objection certificate (NOC). Separate NOCs might be needed for releasing the body, for embalming at the mortuary and if you wish to convey the deceased to his home country. You will get the official death certificate after producing this NOC."
Registering a death,"After getting the official death certificate, register the death with the UAE's  Ministry of Health and Prevention, Ministry  of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Naturalisation and Residency of the emirate of residence. Ministry of Health and Prevention will register the death, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation will attest the death certificate and translation and the Department of Naturalisation and Residency will cancel the visa. The process for registering a death might vary from emirate to emirate and depending on the religion and the residential status of the deceased. In the case of the death of an expatriate, contact the embassy or consulate of his country in the UAE and inform them about his death for further formalities. Deceased expatriates may be cremated or buried in the UAE or their bodies may be sent to their home countries, on showing the requisite documents. If you wish the body of the deceased to be flown back to his home country, you will need the death certificate to be translated and duly attested. You will also need an NOC from the embassy or the consulate of the deceased. The diplomatic mission must cancel the passport and register the death in the home country. Useful links:

Achievements of MBRGI so far,"In the area of combating poverty and disease: The UAE observes that the prevalence of severe poverty in a number of countries and regions across the world is the result of several factors some of which are deeply rooted because of poor international response and the absence of a comprehensive vision to address the issue. The UAE has become a role model in this respect due to its commitment to achieving the objectives of the Millennium Development Goals, which prioritise poverty eradication. Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Initiatives not only provide aid but also combat the root causes of poverty and disease worldwide. Their programmes have assisted 40 million people in 99 countries by 2015. With regard to eradicating poverty specifically, MBRGI and its affiliated bodies have given financial and practical support to more than 1.5 million households in 40 countries. They constructed the largest infrastructure and logistics system in the world on an area of 700,000 square feet to provide facilities and services for charitable and humanitarian institutions. Between 2011 and 2014, the UAE donated 8.9billion AED to eradicate poverty worldwide. In the fight against the spread of disease, their programmes have prevented and treated blindness for 23 million people and provided 81 million vaccines and medications in the past eight years. They have protected 3.6 million children in vulnerable countries from intestinal worms, which threaten their health and future. They have also built 46 hospitals. According to the UAEInteract website, between 1971 and 2014, the UAE spent 2billion AED on projects associated with children's health, education and relief efforts in Asia and Africa. Some of these programmes involved vaccinating children against polio and measles with a special focus on Pakistani and Afghanistani children. In the area of spreading knowledge: In spreading knowledge in other countries, Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Initiatives and its affiliated bodies seek to support education, disseminate knowledge, encourage the research and spread of knowledge, and provide children with healthy learning environment free of disease and its causes. The initiatives in this sector have been responsible for the construction 2,126 schools around the world, training 400,000 teachers, distributing and printing more than 3.2 million books, translating 1,000 knowledge-based books, encouraging millions of students in the Arab world to read 50 million books a year and sustaining Arabic language support initiatives. In 2016, the initiative of Reading Nation was launched. It was a Ramadan campaign aiming at collecting, printing and distributing 5 million books from the UAE to the world. The campaign was launched under the direction of H. H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum in partnership with MBRGI, Dubai Cares and the Emirates Red Crescent. In the area of empowering communities: Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Initiatives holds conferences and grants awards to innovative individuals in the fields of media, art and sports. To date, half a million people have been touched through these initiatives; 67,000 of them are media personnel who have contributed to opening new horizons for media in the region. The Foundation is further concerned with consolidating a cultural discourse characterised by tolerance through investing half a billion AED in cultural understanding initiatives, which have benefited more than 200 nationalities. In the area of entrepreneurship and innovation for the future: The UAE is a regional leader in encouraging entrepreneurship and pioneering innovation. The UAE Government stresses on these as essential keys to sustainable progress. In the recent past, the visionary leaders of the UAE have announced several initiatives and policies in these fields. The UAE recognises industrialisation as the key to economic development. In the area of spreading entrepreneurship and innovation, Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Initiatives and its affiliated bodies aim to train officials and leaders from 155 governmental organisations from various countries around the world, in order to develop the governmental mindset and raise the level of public services. In addition, it has also invested AED 1 billion to create an integrated environment to serve creative innovators locally, regionally and globally through the Museum of the Future."

The UAE's policy on foreign aid,"The UAE's aid has only humanitarian objectives. It is neither governed by politics nor is not limited by geography, race, colour or religion of the beneficiary. This is a practical application of the principle of tolerance and co-existence in the UAE . This policy was laid down by the founder President of the UAE, the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan who stressed that foreign aid and assistance is one of the basic pillars of UAE foreign policy. When formulating its approach to providing foreign aid, the UAE has adopted the idea of sustainable development and improving the welfare of all mankind. In order to consolidate the impact of its foreign aid, the UAE Cabinet has formed the 'UAE Humanitarian Committee', which aims to channel and combine the collective expertise of UAE humanitarian responders in order to facilitate, oversee and coordinate the country's humanitarian aid."
Foreign aid and official development assistance,"According to the UAE Interact website, between 1971 and 2014, government and non-government organisations in the UAE contributed AED 173 billion in foreign aid to 178 countries across the world. The 'UAE's Foreign Aid in 2015' report issued by Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation mentioned that the UAE provided AED 32.34 billion (USD 8.8 billion) in foreign aid during 2015. This contribution was made as foreign assistance to 155 countries through 40 donor entities. Of the 155 countries, 120 were eligible to receive Official Development Assistance (ODA). The UAE spends its foreign aid on developmental projects, humanitarian aid and charitable aid. In 2015, the majority of the aid (92 per cent) was disbursed to development projects, with 6.7 per cent disbursed to humanitarian aid and 1.3 per cent disbursed to charitable assistance. The foreign aid targets priority areas such as: humanitarian assistance, elimination of poverty, support for children, global sectoral programmes such as transportation, infrastructure, governments support and empowerment of women. During 2015, most humanitarian aid was allocated to refugees and internally displaced people affected by crises and conflicts in Syria, Yemen and Iraq. According to geographical distribution, countries in Africa got the largest aid of AED 25.11 billion. Asian countries received AED 6.63 billion. Countries in Europe, North and South America, Oceania and others received AED 586.94 million. The UAE's foreign aid in 2015 was in line with the country's policy of supporting the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The UAE is currently involved in the efforts to achieve UN SDGs.

Benefits of open government data and guidelines,"What is open government data? Government data that is freely available for anyone to use, reuse, distribute or share with others without restrictions is called open government data. As per the UN eGovernment Survey 2018 (PDF, 2 MB) , open government data is government information proactively disclosed and made available online for all to access, without restriction. Benefits of open government data Disclosing government data brings transparency in government transactions and makes them accountable for their actions. It facilitates public scrutiny and evaluation of government performance. Open data helps in efficient use of resources, designing customised service delivery and creation of more jobs. It helps people to make informed decisions about public policies and identify development opportunities. Through all its endeavours, open government data helps to achieve the SDGs . A document issued by World Bank (PDF, 1.5 MB) estimates the direct, annual economic value of open government data in two different studies as up to 40 billion euros throughout the European Union and close to 2 billion pounds in the UK. Increasingly many countries have launched an open data portal. In 2014, just 46 countries had an open data portal. However, in 2018, 139 countries had an open data portal as per the UN eGovernment Survey 2018. The UAE has two data portals: UAE Numbers and Bayanat . The World Bank document brings out the key benefits of open data which are: 
1) Fostering in economic growth and job creation. Open data can promote economic growth by helping launch new businesses, create new jobs, increase efficiency in existing organisations and generally improve the climate for foreign investment. 
2) Improving efficiency, effectiveness and coverage of public services Open data can help strengthen healthcare systems by connecting patients to providers, promote education and ongoing learning, and relieve hunger and improve food security on both a large and small scale. 
3) Increasing transparency, accountability and citizen participation Open data can expose and prevent mismanagement and corruption. It also helps ensure environmental sustainability through transparent data that can help reduce pollution, conserve natural resources, and build resilience to climate change. 
4) Facilitating better information sharing within the government 
 Open data can help improve cities and urban infrastructure. It is key to high-tech smart cities, modern urban planning and the transformation of urban transportation. It can also improve resilience to disasters and ensure that critical resources will be deployed well in emergencies. A picture showing the benefits of open data Source: the UAE’s Ministry of Finance Data Change Management Framework The Dubai Data Change Management Framework provides a practical structure to facilitate transition within the Dubai government. Through a change plan guide, the Dubai Data Manual and supportive toolkits, the Change Management Framework will enable the growth of an effective and sustainable open and shared data culture. Open Data Guidelines The purpose of Open Data Guidelines is to guide the governmental bodies (ministries, agencies, Councils, etc.) what they are required to adhere to when they follow the Open data policy on their website. The scope of this document is limited to the websites of government agencies in the United Arab Emirates. As the document is open for continuous development, its scope can be expanded as dictated by the public policy of the Government of the United Arab Emirates and related instructions. Related links
